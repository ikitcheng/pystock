2020-03-27 18:18:51,2 Reasons to Drive Home the Discount in Tesla Stock,TSLA,Yahoo,"Despite my long-term bullishness, I concede that the wild swings in the markets have been discomfiting for my readers. Truly, we're witnessing an unprecedented response to this crisis that will impose both societal and economic scars. As you might expect, companies which are levered to consumer sentiment like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have taken a beating. At one point, TSLA stock was driving toward four-digit prices. Now, it's well off its record highs.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com Nonetheless, with shares above $500, TSLA stock is actually one of the best-performing stocks of this year, up nearly 21%. That's remarkable considering that the Nasdaq Composite is still down about 15% year-to-date despite recent substantial momentum.On Wednesday, the Senate approved a historic $2 trillion stimulus package, designed to support floundering businesses and provide immediate relief to American families. And Friday it passed in the House of Representatives.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHowever, many questions remain about how the U.S. will fight the coronavirus from China pandemic, and more importantly, how we as a nation will recover. Understandably, broader hesitation exists toward discretionary retail names. Nevertheless, I believe investors can find encouragement that TSLA stock has remained strong amid the turmoil.  * 10 Undervalued Stocks Crashing on the Coronavirus Pandemic That said, here are a few reasons why you should consider Tesla's market discount. TSLA Stock Has a Great PR BoostOn Thursday, it was announced that the U.S. leads the world in coronavirus cases. Although it's not a great statistic, anybody that has been closely following trends understands that this was inevitable. As I'll explain later, it doesn't take away from the fact that we're heading toward the end of this crisis.Unfortunately, the one concerning outlier is the state of New York. At time of writing, it had nearly 39,000 cases, a figure that will explode higher over the next 24 hours. The most crucial problem is that hospitals in high-risk areas such as New York City are desperately running low on beds and ventilators.However, Tesla is stepping up big time, with CEO Elon Musk announcing that he will reopen the New York Gigafactory quickly to manufacture ventilators for Covid-19 patients in that state. For people suffering from the disease, this move is a godsend.Additionally, the perception of the government response has been very negative. Thus, Tesla has the opportunity to play the hero. But will that help TSLA stock?Obviously, it couldn't hurt. But various studies demonstrate that ""modern consumers trade in the currency of goodwill."" And with word of mouth traveling at the speed of light, this is a huge moment for Tesla and TSLA stock. Traditional Automakers Can't Take AdvantageThat said, not everything is going Tesla's way. A significant headwind is that Saudi Arabia and Russia are now engaged in an oil price war. Because this deeply affects the domestic oil industry, the U.S. has urged Saudi Arabia to stand down.We'll see what comes of it. Even if the Saudis end the oil war, it won't immediately send oil back to prior highs. After all, this isn't just a supply issue but rather a demand problem. Thus, with lower prices at the pump, this dynamic theoretically bolsters traditional automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM).The thing is, their shares are in the red for the year, whereas TSLA stock is well in the black. In my opinion, cheap gasoline prices alone won't reverse this circumstance.As you know, the pandemic has been brutal for all automakers due to global supply chain disruptions. Mathematically, though, this headwind impacts traditional manufacturers over the long run more so than it does Tesla and other electric vehicle companies.That's because EVs have fewer moving parts, translating to a simpler, streamlined platform. On the other hand, a car with an internal-combustion engine has tens of thousands of parts. Some could be critical, meaning that a little component built in some far-off land could keep you grounded indefinitely. Bottom Line on TSLA StockTesla remains one of the best-performing stocks on the market in 2020 so far. Additionally, it doesn't stand to be impacted as hard by the coronavirus as some of the other automakers -- meaning TSLA stock remains an interesting pick here.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else. The power of being ""first"" gave Matt's readers the chance to bank +2,438% in Stamps.com (STMP), +1,523% in Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and +1,044% in Tesla (TSLA), just to name a few.

2020-03-27 19:29:56,How Will Traditional Automakers Transition To Electric Vehicles?,TSLA,Yahoo,"Every transition is hard and, usually, expensive. The automotive industry is no different.Even with producers of electric-only vehicles, like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), Neuron EV and Chinese company Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO), the majority of future electric vehicles should come from the existing big automakers, which will have to switch from their current combustion engine models. And they are already doing so by introducing new electric models, electric alternatives of current models, and big plans for future electric vehicle production. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) make the vast majority of their sales from trucks and SUVs. That percentage is 82% today, and it is expected to grow to 87% by 2026. This isn't a new trend. Ford's F-150 has been the top-selling model in the U.S. for many years. As a result, in spite of the plan to aim for emission-free electric cars, sales of trucks and SUVs will likely keep growing to more than 5 million units (SUVs and pickup trucks) in 2026.On the other hand, their production of EVs will also grow, and the two automakers expect to sell approximately 320,000 EV units in 2026. This number may not look impressive, but it is 10 times more than these companies plan to deliver in 2020 (though it is still fewer than the 367,500 units that Tesla delivered in 2019).Things Standing In The Way Of More Electric VehiclesThe current oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia has resulted in an extreme drop in gasoline prices, in some areas lower than< $2 per gallon. This has resulted in a bit of a shock to the electric vehicle market, as one of their keyadvantages has been much cheaper energy costs. Also, the coronavirus pandemic has forced many countries to switch their focus to basic needs like consumer staples, food, obtaining medical equipment like ventilators and other medical supplies. Because of this, companies like Piedmont Lithium Limited (NASDAQ: PLL) are expecting that their projects in the U.S. related to the production of lithium and other elements, materials, and high-tech equipment necessary for electric vehicles will face a year or two of delays. We still have to wait and see what kind of relief measures may be passed by the U.S. government to help stimulate the EV and renewable energy industries. In the meantime, players in this industry will have to cope with the crisis the world's economy is currently in, just like everybody else.

2020-03-30 19:23:20,Another One Bites the Dust: Tesla Reduces Its Nevada Gigafactory Activities,TSLA,Yahoo,"As a response to the COVID-19 outbreak amplifying in the U.S, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) decided to reduce the number of workers in its Gigafactory in Nevada by 75%. This is after its CEO tweeted that he considers the pandemic to be 'dumb' on March 6. Tesla's partner in this Gigafactory, Panasonic Corporation (OTCQX: PCRFY), already closed its operations for all its factory employees. This was not an isolated decision since this massive plant operates in the privately-owned industrial park, Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (or TRIC), which occupies 107,00 acres. In addition to Tesla, TRIC is home to other companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG), Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) distribution center, Switch Inc (NYSE: SWCH) and PetSmart.All the mentioned companies agreed on serious measures, like work from home, creating more distance between workstations, central access and checking employee's temperatures.Tesla's Gigafactories Tesla's big plant in Reno, Nevada, is also known as the Gigafactory 1. The factory produces electric motors and battery packs for Model 3, as well as Powerwalls and Powerpacks, which are Tesla's main energy storage products, made in partnership with Panasonic as the main supplier. This factory is not only important for Tesla's electric car business, but also for other Tesla's business segments like solar and other sustainable energy.Next to Nevada, Tesla has a Gigafactory in Fremont, California, which is responsible for the production of the Model X, Model S, Model Y, as well as Model 3. The California factory also operates with reduced capacity.Gigafactory 3 is located in Shanghai, China, and it currently produces 3,000 electric cars per week, to partially compensate for the reduced capacities of the U.S. plants. The Chinese Gigafactory was also shut down around Chinese New Year, for the holidays, but also in part due to the coronavirus crisis. Before the shutdown, the Chinese factory was producing around 2,000 units.Gigafactory 4 will be produced in the home of German auto giant Volkswagen AG/ADR (OTCQX: VWAGY), close to Berlin.Results Estimates As traditional automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) decided to suspend their production in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, so did Tesla. Before the decision to reduce the factory capacities to essential only, the Wall Street analysts estimated that Tesla might deliver around 106,000 vehicles in its first fiscal quarter. However, the factory suspension decreased these estimates by 22%, to 82,000 units, as well the stock target price to $425 (from $710). Tesla's supply chain might also be the reason for this drop. A lot of components are supposed to come from a single manufacturer, so disruptions of the supply chain could impact the company's ability to complete and deliver its products. On the other hand, Tesla had a strong cash position in its balance sheet, $6.3 billion at the end of 2019, before its recent capital increase of $2.3 billion. This high liquidity level should help the electric car pioneer sail through this uncertain period.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) employee at the Nevada gigafactory tested positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), around the time the company decided to reduce staff at the manufacturing plant by over 70 percent.What Happened In an internal memo on Sunday, Tesla supplier Panasonic Corporation (OTC: PCRFY) informed employees that one of the automaker's employees at the plant has tested positive, KRNV NBC Reno reported.The Tesla employee was at the gigafactory for an hour on March 21, before going home for being sick.Panasonic told employees that the worker didn't have a connection with the battery maker's own production processes.According to the memo reported by KRNV, Tesla activated a safety protocol after the results became known, which included a ""14-day quarantine for particular employees identified by their [environment, health, and safety] team and certain cleaning measures.""Why It Matters Tesla decided to reduce the staff at the Nevada plant by 75% earlier last week, as notified by the local county manager. Panasonic had suspended all operations at the plant a week before.The automaker's CEO Elon Musk has changed his tune over the coronavirus over the month.Earlier this month, he downplayed the impact of COVID-19 with a tweet claiming that ""coronavirus panic is dumb."" A few weeks later, Musk wrote to the employees that ""the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself,"" as reported by Electrek at the time.The billionaire entrepreneur said that no employee should feel pressured to come to work if they feel ""slightest bit ill or even uncomfortable"" during the pandemic, but he himself would continue to come to work every day.The exchange between Tesla and Alameda county officials suggested that the company also initially resisted the shelter-in-place orders put by local authorities at its Fremont Factory.The local authorities ruled that Tesla isn't an essential business and must only maintain minimum basic operations at the site.The automaker later shut down both Fremont and New York factories due to the restrictions imposed by authorities to curb the pandemic.The Palo Alto-based company has instead said it is making ventilators for patients who fall critically ill from COVID-19 and require breathing support. California Governor Gavin Newsom earlier said that Tesla already delivered the 1,000 ventilators it promised in less than a week.Price Action Tesla's shares closed 2.38% lower at $502.13 on Monday. The shares traded 0.17% higher at $503 in the after-hours session.Photo Credit: Courtesy of Tesla.See more from Benzinga  * Microsoft Shares Jump 8.5% As Company Reports Massive Increase In Teams Usage  * Amarin Shares Drop 67% As Court Invalidates Its Heart Drug Patent For Vascepa  * Feds Investigate Senators For Insider Trading Ahead Of Coronavirus-Caused Stock Market Crash(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-03-31 13:19:00,Tesla target lowered at JMP after analyst makes cut to delivery estimates,TSLA,Yahoo,"JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha lowered his price target on shares of Tesla Inc. to $840 from $1,060 on Tuesday, though he maintained a market outperform rating on the stock. Osha also reduced his 2020 delivery estimates to 433,000 units from 523,000, citing a negative impact from the COVID-19 outbreak. ""For Q1, we think more of the reductions likely flowed from Asia and Europe, with the situation reversing in Q2 and the U.S. market leading the decline,"" he wrote.

'Quarter-End-Wave' May Not Materialize, Says Credit Suisse Credit Suisse was projecting about 94,000 first-quarter deliveries in the period just after Tesla's fourth-quarter print, but the numbers are now likely to come in at 75,000-80,000 units, Credit Suisse's Levy said in a Tuesday note. The analyst said he prefers a range of numbers given the uncertainty that prevailed into the end of the quarter.On a positive note, production numbers could come in at 100,000 units -- but Tesla's reliance on a ""quarter-end-wave"" places the delivery numbers at risk due to the growing pandemic at the end of the quarter, he said. Deliveries in the January-February period were soft, likely due to seasonality and EV tax credit roll-off in the U.S. and Netherlands, according to Credit Suisse.Sales in China in the two months remained steady, although the weekly sales pace of 700 units trailed the target of 3,000 per week pace due to the coronavirus and the Chinese New Year, Levy said. ""While Tesla noted in its production shutdown release that it was planning to implement touchless deliveries, we nevertheless would expect Tesla volume to see some impact - especially given the heavy weight of sales to California, where a 'stay at home' order is in place,"" the analyst said. With  Model Y deliveries  having kicked off in the first quarter, Credit Suisse expect deliveries of only around 1,000 in the quarter.See also:  Argus Downgrades Tesla On Coronavirus Impact, Slashes 2020 Delivery Forecast By 19% COVID-19 Headwinds Complicate Tesla's Delivery Trajectory, Says Wedbush Along with other auto manufacturers, Tesla has been seeing demand softness globally over the last month as consumers prioritize food, health and essentials over Model 3 purchases, Wedbush analyst Ives said in a Monday note. The shutdown  of the Fremont factory, which is likely to last at least for another month and probably longer, further complicates Tesla's delivery trajectory for the coming quarters, the analyst said.Ives said he believes hitting the 500,000-plus unit delivery threshold for 2020 is a virtual impossibility. The analyst said he sees 400,000-425,000 as a more realistic estimate.""While cash burn will be heightened in the near term due to this anomalous global situation, we believe the longer-term trends remain very healthy and $20 of annual earnings power down the road is achievable and still remains the target bogey to hit over the coming years for Musk & Co."" For the first quarter, Ives estimates total deliveries of 82,000, with the break-up being 14,000 Model S and X units, 68,000 Model 3 units and a minimum number of Model Ys.""If any company can navigate production hurdles and limited capacity, it's Musk and Tesla looking ahead, which the bulls are betting on to navigate this unprecedented pandemic.""

2020-03-31 20:24:13,How Tesla Fought to Keep Its Plant Open in a Locked-Down City,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s lone U.S. assembly plant posed a risk to public health by staying open for days in spite of San Francisco Bay area shelter-in-place orders, according to documents obtained through a California public records request.Officials with the city of Fremont, California, told Tesla in a series of conversations over several days that its factory was not considered an essential business, and that it therefore needed to comply with an Alameda County order issued March 16. The electric-car maker announced March 19 that it would suspend production four days later.The documents provide a more detailed glimpse of what was a contentious days-long debate between local authorities and Tesla, which sought to stay open based on how the federal government defines critical infrastructure sectors. Fremont’s police chief, the deputy city manager, the county’s health officer and its assistant counsel were among the officials who got involved in the dispute before Tesla backed down.Representatives for Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment on the documents.The Bay area was the first region in the U.S. to enact shelter-in-place orders, a massive effort impacting more than 7 million people. Since then, the coronavirus has wreaked havoc on communities across the country and put immense strain on the global economy. Alameda County had 294 confirmed cases of Covid-19 -- the disease caused by the coronavirus -- as of Tuesday, according to the health department. Seven have died.Virtual MeetingHours before Tesla announced plans to suspend production, Kimberly Petersen, Fremont’s police chief, and other city officials held a virtual meeting on March 19 to follow up on a determination reached the day before: the company had to cease all activities except for minimum basic operations.In a March 21 letter to Tesla, she recounted the city’s efforts to seek clarification as to whether the carmaker was an essential business by consulting with Scott Dickey, the assistant counsel for the county. Dickey relayed a determination from Erica Pan, Alameda County’s health officer.“Mr. Dickey informed city staff that Dr. Pan does not consider Tesla to be an essential business, but rather, considers Tesla’s manufacturing plant to be a public health risk,” Petersen wrote in the letter.Tesla’s plant employs roughly 10,000 people, but many workers commute from elsewhere, including California’s Central Valley. The company told employees last week that two staffers at unspecified offices were confirmed to have Covid-19.A Nevada television station reported Sunday that a Tesla worker at its battery factory near Reno had tested positive, citing an email that cell supplier Panasonic Corp. sent to employees. Tesla had more than 48,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2019.‘Staged Shutdown’When Tesla representatives including Rohan Patel, a senior director of policy and business development who used to work in the Obama administration, met Fremont officials on March 19, they said the company intended to comply with the order, though it needed to conduct a “staged shutdown” of the plant.The two sides agreed that all vehicle manufacturing would cease on March 23. Employees who remained on site would complete work at the end of assembly lines to protect the value of vehicles and batteries, while others would perform basic operations such as security, maintenance and cleaning, all while following social-distancing requirements.“You explicitly agreed to that understanding,” the police chief later wrote. “If you were to transition to manufacturing ventilators, or other equipment intended to aid in the fight against Covid-19, these activities would be permitted.”Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted March 18, the day before the meeting with Fremont officials, that the company would make ventilators “if there is a shortage.” The carmaker has since held discussions with Medtronic Plc, a leading ventilator maker based in Dublin, Ireland, but there’s no indication yet that Tesla will play a role in manufacturing the medical devices.The Right ThingDuring another virtual meeting on Sunday, March 22, Tesla briefly reversed its decision to close its plant. Alan Prescott, Tesla’s acting general counsel, argued the county’s health order had been superseded by a new statewide order issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom. The order included an exception for “critical infrastructure sectors,” a category Tesla claimed included its plant and thus meant the company could continue conducting full operations.After Petersen, the police chief, told Tesla during the meeting that the city was rejecting that argument, Prescott said the company would wind down operations because it was “the right thing to do.”A tweet Musk sent two days earlier suggested Tesla didn’t have a choice -- the factory couldn’t stay open because Tesla’s parts suppliers weren’t going to keep running their plants, he wrote.Petersen told Tesla she would like to schedule an inspection of the company’s facilities on March 24 to ensure compliance.“In closing, I would like to reiterate that the city of Fremont highly values Tesla as a partner and appreciates what you do for our economy and community,” Petersen wrote in one of her emails to the company. “We are extremely grateful for your willingness to collaborate in our fight against the spread of Covid-19 by placing public health ahead of all other priorities.”(Updates the number of Alameda County coronavirus cases in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-03-31 22:00:03,Tesla’s Spoiled End-of-Quarter Push Does a Number on Deliveries,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. tends to pull out all the stops at the end of each quarter, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk often rallying the troops to deliver as many vehicles as possible to customers.This approach probably didn’t work well for Tesla in March, with shelter-in-place orders and distancing guidelines around the globe limiting how many vehicles the company could hand over. While Musk tried to salvage the quarter by introducing a “touchless” delivery option in select locations, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to have done a number on demand for all automakers.Analysts on average estimate Tesla delivered roughly 77,400 cars worldwide last quarter, the first to include hand-overs of the new Model Y crossover. While that would be a jump from a disappointing result a year ago, it also would mark a more than 30% drop from the record deliveries Tesla reported for the last three months of 2019.“Tesla typically delivers a disproportionate share of its quarter’s units in the last two weeks of the quarter,” Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report Monday. “Given the disruption to production and logistics bandwidth, we would be prepared for a weak number.”Jonas, whose projection for 88,000 deliveries is the highest among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News, warned that risk to his estimate is “skewed to the downside.” He expects investors to turn their attention in the coming days to how demand shapes up in the second quarter, the amount of cash Tesla starts burning and the battery day event Musk has said will happen sometime in April.Musk warned back in July -- long before the coronavirus outbreak -- that the first quarter of this year would be “tough.” Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn echoed this during Tesla’s last earnings call in late January, noting that the auto industry is “always impacted by seasonality.”While Tesla issued a forecast in January for 2020 deliveries to comfortably exceed 500,000, the company was “in the the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus,” he said.The impact the virus has had on the industry has been far more severe and widespread than many were expecting then. Business activity in much of the U.S. and Europe has virtually ground to a halt, and Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, suspended production on March 23. Countless would-be car buyers are staying home, unemployment is rising and consumer confidence is plummeting.Tesla issued an “operational update” on March 19 to announce the plant shutdown and the touchless delivery offering, in which customers can unlock their new car using an app and complete any paperwork sitting inside. Other automakers are promoting similar services, though Tesla may have an advantage by having embraced an online sales model.While the company didn’t comment on its guidance for 2020 deliveries in that update, it did say the $2.3 billion raised in a February equity offering left it with a sum of cash that will be “sufficient to successfully navigate an extended period of uncertainty.”Tesla did still deliver some cars as the quarter came to a close, even to areas hit hard by the virus. Howard Feinstein, who lives in a rural community outside Seattle, took delivery of his $69,200 Model Y Performance on March 28. Two Tesla employees dropped off the vehicle directly to his house.“Tesla went out of their way to make sure that we didn’t have any contact,” Feinstein said in a phone interview. “We went over the plan by phone prior to their arrival, and the employees always stood more than 10 feet away from me.”Tesla is far from alone in idling production in the U.S., and the company now has a second plant, near Shanghai, that restarted assembly lines with the help of government authorities in China. The carmaker typically doesn’t give a breakdown in its deliveries reports of results by country or region.“Given that China was shut down in February and probably slow in March, plus the U.S. froze in March, I’m expecting horrible numbers from everyone,” David Whiston, a Morningstar Inc. analyst, said in an email. “China and the U.S. were 64% of Tesla’s revenue last year for the full year, so a collapse there will be painful.”Tesla shares, which closed up as much as 112% for the year in mid-February, briefly gave up all 2020 gains when equity markets reached a low point midway through the month. The stock was back up 25% as of Tuesday’s close.“We think impacts of current production downtime are beginning to be incorporated into estimates, but are monitoring longer-term virus ramifications, including the potential for a global recession,” Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst, wrote in a report Tuesday. “We think a longer-term economic downturn could adversely impact demand for several quarters, which could be an overhang on shares.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The proposal estimates costs of $200 million to $300 million and would accommodate more renewable energy production across the island, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. Banks of liquid-cooled, lithium­-ion batteries could become the first and biggest stand-alone, utility-scale energy battery system tied to the grid of Hawaii’s largest utility. The plan involves placing Tesla batteries in 244 lockers, with each one extending 23 feet (7 meters). Hawaiian Electric proposed developing the project in 2021 on land next to its Kahe power plant in Nanakuli on Oahu, along with four smaller energy storage facilities on Oahu, Maui and Hawaii island. The five storage systems are subject to a competitive bidding program in which Hawaiian Electric is the initiator but also a competitor and initial decision maker. The state Public Utilities Commission has independent observers and a technical adviser to oversee the process and proposals. Hawaiian Electric solicited bids in August for renewable energy production and storage systems of about 900 megawatts on Oahu, Maui and Hawaii island. The initiative is expected to be the largest push for renewable energy in Hawaii so far. Hawaiian Electric plans to select the winning bids in May. A majority of the new capacity, about 600 megawatts, is planned for Oahu and could be developed with or without attached battery storage. Hawaiian Electric believes the company can produce stand-alone storage at a reasonable cost because of its capacity to build battery facilities on land it owns next to substations that reduce infrastructure connection costs, spokeswoman Sharon..."

Over the past month, the stock decreased by 34.02%, but over the past year, it actually went up by 84.67%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently down from its 52 week high by 48.97%. The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Tesla has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 44.34 of the auto manufacturers industry. Ideally, one might believe that they might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued.P/E ratio is not always a great indicator of the company's performance.

2020-04-01 23:10:04,Tesla’s New Model Y Gets High Marks From a Critic Musk Respects,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s new Model Y has what people have come to expect from Elon Musk’s cars: It’s lightning quick, handles nicely and has better electronic gadgetry than its competitors.Unlike past Tesla offerings, early versions are rolling off the assembly line looking more like you’d expect from a company with a handle on the finer points of car building, according to Sandy Munro. The manufacturing consultant who’s been tearing cars apart piece-by-piece for three decades offered his initial impressions before digging into the Model Y that his shop took delivery of this week.“I don’t have much negative to say,” Munro said in an interview. “It’s much better than the Model 3 when we got it. We found problems, but the average car buyer won’t even see these things.”Munro and his eponymous firm have been well known for years among Detroit’s automotive engineers for their in-depth analysis of hundreds of cars from virtually every manufacturer. He gained wider notoriety by tearing down the Model 3 -- Musk’s first attempt at a mass-manufactured car -- two years ago.In April 2018, Munro offered a mixed review of an early-build Model 3, praising Tesla’s technology while also calling out some serious manufacturing flaws. After a few more months of close consideration, his firm found potential for Musk to make the sedan profitably.Musk, who’s not always one to roll with the punches from critics, praised Munro for his engineering prowess in January.Walking around his firm’s recently purchased Model Y, Munro used a small measuring stick to find inconsistent gaps between body panels and the hood of the vehicle. He found similar spaces between the tail lights and rear body parts.But he gives the five-passenger Model Y high marks for its cavernous cargo space. The crossover is only a touch longer than the BMW X3 but much roomier with the rear seats folded down.Tesla also is clearly benefiting from a powertrain edge. Munro said two years ago that the Model 3’s battery pack and electric motors were the best he’d seen.

2020-04-02 20:40:59,"Tesla Deliveries Beat Analysts’ Estimates, Sparking Stock Rally",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s early-year deliveries fell less than expected from record levels reached late last year, sending the shares soaring as much as 14% in late trading.Tesla handed over 88,400 vehicles worldwide in the first quarter, down 21% from the last three months of 2019. But the total beat analysts’ average estimate for about 78,100.“I’m shocked they did so well,” Gene Munster, managing partner of venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said by phone. “I don’t know how they did it. They had every excuse in the world to put out a bad number.”Musk, 48, tried to salvage as much business as possible last month by introducing “touchless” deliveries at a time when authorities around the globe are urging would-be car buyers to shelter in place. While Tesla managed to deliver more vehicles than the year-ago quarter, the improvement was small considering the company added a new product -- the Model Y -- and opened an assembly plant in China.Tesla didn’t give an update on whether it still expects to deliver at least 500,000 vehicles this year. The carmaker’s stock was up 12% as of 4:40 p.m. Thursday in New York.Analysts anticipate Tesla will sustain a significant blow along with all other automakers from the spread of the viral illness known as Covid-19. With a global recession increasingly likely, consumers are expected to be less interested in making big-ticket purchases like new vehicles even once they’re able to leave their homes.Model YThe vehicles delivered in the quarter include the first Model Y crossovers that started reaching customers in mid March. Musk has predicted it will be a big seller, potentially eclipsing the combined volume of all other vehicles in Tesla’s lineup: the Model 3, S and X.Tesla didn’t say how many vehicles it built during the quarter at its plant near Shanghai, which started production late last year. While the company suspended output when measures to contain the coronavirus forced plant closures across China, government authorities bent over backward to help the company reopen quickly.“The production number was very good, especially with what was going on in China,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, said of the 102,672 vehicles Tesla built in the quarter. He isn’t bothered by the company neglecting to update its 2020 forecast. “It shows they don’t have visibility in this environment. Saying nothing is better than saying something at this point.”‘Small Victory’Tesla’s lone U.S. assembly plant in Fremont, California, stopped production on March 23 after days of back-and-forth with city and county officials. San Francisco Bay area health authorities have since extended “stay-at-home” orders to at least May 3.Tesla delivered over 14,000 fewer cars than it produced in the quarter, meaning the automaker built inventory.Musk warned back in July -- long before the coronavirus outbreak -- that the first quarter of this year would be “tough.” Tesla’s vehicles are no longer eligible for federal tax credits in the U.S., and buyers also are getting less-generous support from the Netherlands, a market that contributed to record fourth-quarter deliveries.“I view it as a small victory during a dark time,” said Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who rates Tesla a hold. “The devil is in the details and the big question is around 2Q cash burn given this unprecedented, treacherous environment.”(Updates with Munster’s comment in third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

It also didn't give an estimate of its expectations for the second quarter.Loup Ventures would give their estimate for the second quarter when there's better clarity surrounding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.Munster reiterated his earlier stance that during the pandemic, Tesla's performance relative to other automakers matters more than its performance on absolute terms.According to him, Tesla will continue to beat other automaker delivery results by 15% to 25% in the rest of the three quarters this year, even as things get more difficult for the overall industry.If the pandemic's impact is eased by October, Tesla will see a ""dramatic bounce back"" in the fourth quarter, as per Munster.""The biggest unknown will be production contribution from Shanghai, which is still in the early ramp phase,"" he added.Tesla's Fremont and New York manufacturing plants are closed for production due to shelter in place orders from local authorities during the pandemic.

2020-04-03 12:30:29,Tesla Analysts Look Beyond Strong Deliveries to Advocate Caution,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares soared in pre-market trading after the electric vehicle maker’s first-quarter delivery numbers impressed investors.Yet, even though the better-than-expected results suggested demand for Tesla cars remained strong, both bullish and bearish analysts warned that the company will not escape unscathed as the novel coronavirus pandemic brings demand for autos across the world to an abrupt halt.The company did not provide any update to its full-year delivery guidance, or on profitability or liquidity, something that the market had hoped to see amid the extreme uncertainties brought on by the Covid-19 crisis.“The company also did not break out any quantitative metrics around China or Model Y production and sales, which will likely disappoint both bulls, who see these as massive growth opportunities, and bears who are skeptical of demand in the other regions and demand for the Model 3,” Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said.Tesla shares jumped 16% in pre-market trading to $528.Here’s a round-up of the analyst comments on the delivery figures.Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi“Fist-quarter deliveries reaffirm strong market demand for Teslas.”“88,000 units was only 10,000 shy of our pre-Covid 19 forecast for the quarter, suggesting underlying demand was at least tracking in-line – and likely ahead – of our expectations, and grew 40% year over year, despite headwinds such as the expiration of U.S. and Dutch EV incentives.”“Tesla’s multiple is predicated on its growth profile, and strong first-quarter deliveries despite the shock of coronavirus – is clearly positive/reassuring.”Wedbush, Dan Ives“With the second half of March seeing a screeching halt in demand across the globe given the current pandemic, the big question for investors going forward is around the demand trajectory for 2Q/rest of the year and cash burn.”“It appears China production and demand are starting to rebound and should be a key growth driver over the coming quarters, although clear challenges remain in the months ahead as Tesla navigates this treacherous consumer landscape and spending environment abound.”“While cash burn will be heightened in the near term due to this anomalous global situation, we believe the longer-term trends remain very healthy and $20 of annual earnings power down the road is achievable.”Rates neutral, with a price target of $425.RBC, Joseph Spak“We don’t dismiss that Covid-19 and the ‘shutdown’ impacted Tesla deliveries, but we’ve heard some very low forecasts over the past week (in the 60,000 range) that have significantly, and in our view, unrealistically, lowered expectations.”“We hesitate to even really call this a ‘beat.”’Rates underperform.Cowen, Jeffrey Osborne“Deliveries came in better than our expectations, reflecting a stronger end of quarter push than our Covid-19 adjusted estimates, but production utilization was quite low in the quarter compared to stated capacity levels - even factoring in stated shutdowns.”“Free cash flow in first quarter likely not as bad as we feared, but second-quarter setup still looks rough, and we still expect a U-shaped recovery in 2H of 2020.”Rates underperform, price target $285.Needham, Rajvindra Gill“Despite the strong numbers, we remain cautious on Tesla’s deliveries for the remainder of 2020, as automotive demand has largely collapsed in North America and Europe due to the impact of Covid-19.”“It is unclear when the Fremont factory will be back online, significantly hampering Tesla’s production capacity.”“In the long-term, we continue to expect margin pressure from declining sales of higher-margin Model S & X vehicles, a lower mix within Model 3, and competitive pressures from other automakers as they launch their electric vehicles over the next few years.”Rates underperform.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The company said late Thursday that the 88,400 vehicles it delivered during the quarter marked its ""best ever"" first quarter, despite the negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said the deliveries were ""robustly ahead"" of his expectations.

2020-04-03 15:00:31,Tesla Analysts Dissect &#39;Surprisingly Strong&#39; Q1 Deliveries Data,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares gained 13.5% on Friday morning after the company reported first-quarter vehicle delivery numbers that weren't as bad as many investors had feared.Tesla delivered 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020, up 40.3% from a year ago and well ahead of consensus analyst estimates of 79,900. Prior to COVID-19 related shutdowns, analysts had been anticipating 95,528 deliveries.Following its last earnings call, Tesla management said it would ""comfortably exceed"" 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020, an average quarterly rate of 125,000 vehicles. To hit that mark, Tesla will now need to average 137,200 deliveries over the next three quarters.Analysts had mixed opinions of Tesla shares following the latest delivery numbers. Here's a sampling of what they had to say.Good Enough CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said the delivery report will help ease investors' concerns over the negative impact of coronavirus (COVID-19).""In light of the stock's YTD outperformance and with the Fremont factory having been idle since March 23 (and the number of Covid-19 cases in the Bay area continuing to escalate), we remain cautious on the shares and the company's near-term earnings outlook,"" Nelson wrote.Bank of America analyst John Murphy said Tesla's delivery numbers weren't great, but they're good enough given the circumstances.""We would note that, as production outstripped deliveries in 1Q:20 for the first time in several quarters, this could translate into a cash headwind for TSLA in the quarter, in addition to costs associated with the production shutdown, although we expect TSLA's recent capital raise ($2.3bn equity) is more than enough to cushion the blow for now,"" Murphy wrote.See Also: Tesla Is 'Crushing The Auto Industry', Munster SaysUncertain Trajectory Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the first-quarter numbers were a moral victory for a company facing a bleak near-term outlook.""With the second half of March seeing a screeching halt in demand across the globe given the current pandemic, the big question for investors going forward is around the demand trajectory for 2Q/rest of the year and cash burn as this uncertain consumer environment plays out in the field,"" Ives wrote.Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said the first-quarter numbers weren't good enough to change his full-year delivery estimate of 438,000 vehicles.""It is very difficult to predict how Tesla will fare during Q2 (due to COVID-19), and we prefer to err on the side of caution,"" Potter wrote.Ratings And Price Targets   * CFRA has a Hold rating and $480 target.  * Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $500 target.  * Wedbush has a Neutral rating and $425 target.  * Piper Sandler has an Overweight rating and $819 target.Tesla's stock traded at $491 per share at time of publication.Latest Ratings for TSLA  DateFirmActionFromTo  Mar 2020Piper SandlerMaintainsOverweight  Mar 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight  Mar 2020Argus ResearchDowngradesBuyHold    View More Analyst Ratings for TSLA   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Tesla, Wayfair And Other Profitable Short Trades Could Get A Short Covering Boost  * Benzinga CEO Talks Hedging Bets, Dividend Plays On PreMarket Prep  * Here's How Much Investing 0 In The 2018 Nio IPO Would Be Worth Today(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

""There's still a lot of work to do, but we're giving it our best effort,"" one of the employees said.Tesla had to shut down its Fremont and New York factories for regular production due to the shelter in place orders imposed by local authorities.The automaker's chief executive officer Elon Musk later said the New York gigafactory would be reopened to produce ventilators for patients who fall critically ill from infecting the coronavirus and require breathing support.Tesla earlier delivered the promised 1,000 ventilators to the government of California, but the company hadn't manufactured the ventilators itself.Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) also said last week that it would make 50,000 ventilators in the next 100 days, in collaboration with the General Electric Company's (NYSE: GE) healthcare subsidiary.There are 337,310 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States at press time, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and 9,643 people have died from the virus in the country,Price Action Tesla's shares closed 5.62% higher at $480.01 on Friday.

2020-04-06 09:46:47,JPMorgan Picks 2 Stocks to Buy (and 1 to Sell),TSLA,Nasdaq,"Last month, the S&P 500 hit bottom at 2,192 and has staged a mild rally since. The index closed out last week at 2,488. These numbers are important – if they hold, they’ll give traders a degree of confidence that the worst is past, at least in the stock market.



JPMorgan strategist Jason Hunter is making the case for just that: ""The number of states with above 20% COVID-19 confirmed daily case growth already saw a sharp drop from 40 to below 10 into early April. We are interested to see if that deceleration continues and starts to impact the number of states with growth rates above 10%. Based on the recent correlation, case growth deceleration in that group can help put further downward pressure on implied equity volatility and blunt the nature of a retest of the March equity price low.”



Hunter sees 2,100 serving as a floor to the S&P 500 moving forward in April, with a ceiling in the range of 2,750 to 2,850. The strategist expects the index to level out at or near its current level, as volatility dampens in response to slowdown in the spread of coronavirus. In New York and New Jersey, the hardest-hit states in the US, Sunday saw the first declines in the daily report of COVID-19 deaths. Hunter sees it as hopeful, saying, “As NYC marked one of the earlier major outbreaks in the U.S., we suspect further growth rate deceleration over the next week or so could help improve market sentiment.”



There’s hope that improving sentiment may mark the beginning a virtuous cycle, and perhaps the turn of the tide for the markets. In the meantime, JPMorgan stock analysts are scrutinizing the market, looking the for the right stocks to get that kickstarted.



We’ve pulled up three of the investment bank's recent calls, and run them through the TipRanks database. It turns out that two of the firm’s bullish picks have received significant support from other members of the Street. That being said, one name stands out as being an investment to avoid, falling out of favor with JPMorgan as well as the broader analyst community. Let’s take a closer look.



Cabot Corporation (CBT)



We’ll start in the chemical industry, where Cabot provides a wide variety of products, including carbon and carbon compounds, ink colorants, rare elements such as tantalum, niobium, ad germanium, and a range of specialty fluids. The company’s products have applications in adhesives, air, water, and chemical purification, construction, coatings, light industry, oil drilling – and even in the food and beverage niche.



Cabot reported its fiscal Q1 earnings early in February, for the period ending in December, and the results were disappointing. Revenues were down 11% year-over-year, to $727 million, while the 69 cents EPS missed the forecast by 9% and was down 20% year-over-year. It was not a good footing for the company as the coronavirus epidemic was ramping up.



Nevertheless, there were some high points. The company’s cash flow exceeded capex by $37 million, and Cabot ended the quarter with $173 million in cash on hand – a 22% increase from year before. Looking forward, management is guiding toward full year earnings of $3.60 to $3.90 per share, in line with previous estimates.



The solid cash position underlies the company’s dividend, which Cabot has been paying out reliably for the last 19 years. The current quarterly payment, after three increases in the past three years, is 35 cents, and the annualized payment of $1.40 gives a yield of 5.4%. The average yield among peer companies in the consumer goods sector is 2.5%, making Cabot’s more than double. The payout ratio, at 50%, shows both a commitment to sharing profits with shareholders, and plenty of room for additional increases.



Reviewing Cabot for JPMorgan, analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas saw fit to upgrade the stock from Neutral to Buy. He wrote, “The likely strength of Cabot’s cash flows gives us confidence that Cabot will pay its dividend, which now represents a 5.4% yield in a longer-term interest rate environment close to 1%... We believe that Cabot is likely to return to its 2019 level of value and earnings over a three year period (by F2022), and so we think that the returns to the equity holder will approach a doubling of value over that period.”



Zekauskas also raised his price target by 19%, to $31, indicating his confidence in a 19% upside for the stock. (To watch Zekauskas’ track record, click here)



Over the past 3 months, four other analysts have thrown the hat in with a view on the chemicals and materials maker. The three additional Buy ratings provide Cabot with a Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $35.25, investors stand to take home an 36% gain, should the target be met over the next 12 months. (See Cabotvstock analysis on TipRanks)







T-Mobile US (TMUS)



It’s been a memorable spring for T-Mobile, for more than just the obvious reasons. The company on April 1 completed its long merger process with Sprint, making Sprint a wholly owned subsidiary company. The companies were the third and fourth largest wireless carriers in the US market, and together boasted 140 million subscribers at the end of 2019, along with a combined $77.5 billion in top-line revenue. The merger process has taken two years to complete.



T-Mobile started the merger process in 2018, with an eye ahead toward 5G. The company sought to increase its customer base, infrastructure, and available capital resources for the rollout of the new networks. That rollout got started this past December, before the merger was complete, when T-Mobile launched 5G digital in over 5,000 cities and towns, covering some 200 million people.



The good news for TMUS did not end there. The company saw positive results in the fourth quarter, reporting 87 cents EPS and $11.9 billion in top-line quarterly revenue. The EPS was 4.8% above the estimates, and up 16% year-over-year. The revenue number also beat the forecast, and gained 3.4% yoy.



5-star JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick looks at the implications of the completed Sprint merger for TMUS, and writes, “We believe that T-Mobile will continue to offer a solid product for a lower price than peers AT&T and Verizon, and that the combined company’s network in a few years will be closer to parity with larger peers than it is today, offering more relative value to customers over time.”



""Trading at 7.3x 2021E core EBITDA (or 6.0x including full EBITDA synergies) vs 6.6x Verizon and 6.3x AT&T we see T-Mobile as attractive,"" Cusick concluded.



Cusick is impressed enough by the possibilities to initiate coverage of the stock with a Buy rating. His $110 price target suggests an impressive 34% upside potential. (To watch Cusick’s track record, click here.)



T-Mobile’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 11 Buys that overbalance the single Hold. Shares are selling for $81.98, and the average price target of $103.36 implies a 26% premium. (See T-Mobile’s stock analysis at TipRanks)







Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)



Tesla has had its ups and downs, and Elon Musk’s genius for generating headlines has made sure that everyone knows about it. In recent weeks, the company has met the COVID-19 crisis with a ventilator prototype made from electric car parts, which is good, and not just as a possible aid in meeting a serious public health need.



The electric car giant is facing an automotive production shortfall, as its Shanghai Gigafactory, part of Tesla’s battery supply chain, is unlikely to meet the supply needs of the company’s US, UK, and Australian operations. And in the US, Tesla has been forced to shut down production at its Fremont, California plant since March 23. The shutdown comes just as the company was intending to scale up Model Y SUV production to meet increased demand.



Production shortfalls are meeting increased demand, as Tesla earlier this month boasted high electric vehicle sales in Q1. The company reported over 88,000 vehicle deliveries in the quarter, with 76,200 of those being the lower-priced Model Y and Model 3. Quarterly production reached over 102,000 units, and marked the company’s best ever Q1 performance. This was, simply put, a bad time for the COVID-19 epidemic to hit the production lines.



Investors have taken notice. TSLA shares are down 47% in the current market slump, a severe underperformance compared to the broader markets.



JPMorgan’s 5-star analyst Ryan Brinkman believes ""2Q will prove much more challenging (we forecast deliveries -36% q/q to just 57,000), including of course because of COVID-19 but possibly also as a result of the stronger than expected 1Q figures which may have left [production] channels full.”



As a result, Brinkman maintains his Sell rating on TSLA shares, with a price target that, at $240, suggests a 50% downside in the coming year. (To watch Brinkman’s track record, click here)



Wall Street agrees that Tesla is a risky play. The stock gets a Hold from the analyst consensus, based on a mix of reviews including 4 Buys, 14 Holds, and 10 Sells. The stock is not cheap, and even now sells for $480, while the $505 average price target implies a modest upside of 5.24%. (See Tesla’s stock analysis at TipRanks)

It took about five years for peer auto sales to recover from the 2008 recession, Kallo wrote in a note to clients. ""That said, we do think TSLA could fare better than luxury peers, with new products/geographies driving growth, a potentially widening EV competitive advantage, and OTA updates keeping vehicles fresh,"" the analyst wrote. Model 3 comps reached peak U.S. sales in 2007 but then fell about 31% during the crisis and only hit a trough in 2009, he wrote. It was another roughly six years before recovering to pre-recession highs. ""Similarly, U.S. auto SAAR took 5-6 years to recover to pre-recession levels after declining ~35% between 2007 and 2009,"" said the note. {""While the 2008 downturn was clearly an outlier historically, if the duration of recoveries is similar we think there could be an overhang on demand.""

However, he said the company had four major advantages in the long term:  1. As the auto industry transitions to electric over time, Tesla will not have to deal with the upgrade costs that the legacy automakers do.  2. Not only is Tesla gaining market share from legacy automakers, EVs are a positive-sum game.  3. Tesla is roughly ""doubling market coverage with Model Y.""  4. Tesla is leading an auto technology revolution.Despite his bullish long-term outlook, Houchois said Tesla investors should expect some challenging 2020 numbers after the company reported 88,400 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter.Jefferies is projecting $6.1 billion in first-quarter revenue for Tesla, up 34.3% from a year ago. The firm is also projecting auto gross margins will contract by 3.1% to 17.8% and negative free cash flow of $250 million.""Looking further out, we see Tesla's ability to attract capital as a strong positive as pressure on the industry's transformation accelerates,"" Houchois wrote.Following Tesla's $2.2 billion first-quarter capital raise, Jefferies is projecting the company will finish the first quarter with $4.6 billion in net debt.Benzinga's Take Tesla will likely get a free pass when it comes to its near-term numbers in 2020 due to the COVID-19 disruption. For the remainder of the year at least, Tesla shares will likely continue to trade on the stock's long-term story rather than its fundamental business metrics.Do you agree with this take?

2020-04-06 20:54:32,"U.S. Deaths Top 10,000; Possible Plateau in N.Y.: Virus Update",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- More signs emerged that the crisis may be easing in some areas, sending stocks soaring. Italy, France, Germany and Spain reported lower numbers of new cases. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said deaths were showing indications of hitting a plateau. U.K. deaths slowed for a second day, even as they passed the grim milestone of 5,000. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized Sunday after 10 days in isolation, was moved to an intensive-care unit.JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he expects a major economic downturn and stress similar to the crisis that almost brought down the U.S. financial system in 2008.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he’ll propose a state of emergency in some prefectures.Key Developments:Global cases top 1.3 million; deaths exceed 73,000: Johns HopkinsU.S. deaths surpass 10,000: Johns HopkinsTrump, Biden spoke by phone about the outbreakMilken Conference postponed a second time to OctoberDenmark, Austria began to relax measuresNew York state lockdown extended to April 29Denmark Joins Austria in Easing Curbs (4:38 p.m. NY)Denmark joined Austria in announcing a gradual relaxation of measures imposed to slow the coronavirus’s spread. The country will press ahead with a “cautious reopening” starting with kindergartens and primary schools on April 15 if the virus numbers remain stable, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. The government will also start talks with business leaders on gradually moving employees back into offices.Austria said earlier that it would take its first steps toward restarting its economy. The two countries were among the first in Europe to shut down public life in response to the outbreak. Wisconsin Governor Delays Tuesday Primary (3:15 p.m. NY)Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers suspended in-person voting just hours before the state’s primary was scheduled to begin, though the order could be subject to a court challenge.Although 15 states and Puerto Rico have already postponed their primaries amid the coronavirus pandemic, Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled legislature has rejected requests by Evers, a Democrat, to delay the state’s in-person voting on Tuesday.Evers’s executive order delays in-person voting until June 9 unless the legislature acts to change it.French Cases Leveling Off (1:50 p.m. NY)France reported a continued leveling-off of cases, signaling that confinement measures are starting to contain the crisis.The country had 3,912 new confirmed cases on Monday, fewer than it reported in five out of the past seven days, according to figures presented by Health Minister Olivier Veran. Deaths from the virus rose by 833 to 8,911, Veran said.“The pressure is still very great on hospitals, enormous -- the confinement has to continue,” Veran said. Still, he said there was some reason for optimism. “We can see that the confinement has a palpable effect in France, we’re starting to feel it.”Read more hereWHO May Announce Move This Week to Accelerate Vaccine (1:30 p.m. NY)A new program to accelerate vaccine development and production may be announced this week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press briefing in Geneva.“The difficulty for governments right now is that lockdowns are proving effective in dampening the flames of the epidemic in those countries, but those lockdowns are also causing great economic hardship,” said Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program. Still, he said it would probably be “very inadvisable” to lift a lockdown completely all at once.“Once you raise the lockdown, you have to have an alternative method to suppress the virus -- active case finding, testing, isolation, tracking of contacts and strong community education,” Ryan said.N.Y. Deaths May Signal Possible Plateau (1:10 p.m. NY)New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said deaths from the coronavirus pandemic were showing signs of hitting a plateau in the state that has become the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.The challenge, he cautioned Monday, is to maintain the social distancing that has finally pointed New York toward a possible peak in fatalities. For a second day in a row, the percentage increase in the death toll was less than 10%, a turnabout from numbers about twice as large barely a week ago.The peak of the outbreak could fall on the earlier side of the state’s models showing that it could take anywhere from a week to 30 days for the situation to hit its worse.“I get that people are cooped up,” Cuomo said in his daily press briefing. “But, we get reckless, we change and we’re not compliant on social distancing, you’ll see those numbers go up again.”He doubled the fine for social-distancing violations to $1,000.Italy’s New Virus Infections Lowest in Almost Three Weeks (12:20 p.m. NY)Italy reported the lowest number of new coronavirus infections in nearly three weeks, prompting debate over how and when the country should start emerging from a nationwide lockdown.Civil protection authorities reported 3,599 new cases of the disease on Monday, compared with 4,316 a day earlier. Italy registered 636 new deaths linked to the virus, compared with 525 the day before. That brings the total number of fatalities to 16,523.Italy, once the epicenter for Europe, now has fewer cases than Spain and the U.S.California to Send Ventilators to National Stockpile (12:16 p.m. NY)California, which has yet to see its hospitals overrun by patients, plans to loan 500 state-owned ventilators to the national stockpile.“We’re aggressively preparing for a surge -- but we can’t turn our backs on Americans whose lives depend on having a ventilator now,” Governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.With the New York area experiencing a supply shortage, other states are stepping in to assist. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said this weekend that Oregon offered to send 140 ventilators to his state.Merkel Says Too Soon to Ease Lockdown (11:43 a.m. NY)It’s too early for Germany to set a date for easing its lockdown, Chancellor Angela Merkel said, holding her first press conference since returning from 12 days of self-confinement after being exposed to Covid-19.She reiterated her support for the use of the European Stability Mechanism and the European Commission’s proposal for job protection, and said the continent will need a plan for reconstruction after the pandemic subsides.At least three tests showed she was free of the virus.Philippines Likely to Extend Lockdown (11:43 a.m. NY)Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he’s inclined to extend a lockdown of more than half the country’s population on its main island until April 30 to further stem the coronavirus outbreak.Duterte, in an address late Monday, also said he’s considering tweaking this year’s 4.1 trillion-peso ($80.8 billion) budget to allocate more funds to virus response, as some 200 billion pesos set aside for cash grants to poor families won’t be enough.Israel Cuts Rates for First Time Since 2015 (9:33 a.m. NY)The Bank of Israel shifted course by cutting interest rates and adding new market-based tools.

2020-04-06 22:11:50,"Tesla: Despite Record Q1 Numbers, Uncertainty Looms Ahead",TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) and its mercurial CEO Elon Musk are never far from the headlines and not always for the right reasons, but last week the company delivered some good news, as it announced its best Q1 ever. Tesla produced 102,672 vehicles and delivered 88,400 in the quarter, 76,260 of which were Model 3s, with the rest taken up by Models S & X. The numbers take into account the shutdown of Tesla's Fremont factory on March 23. The figure also easily beat the Street’s estimate, which called for a total of 79,900 deliveries. Musk also began delivering Model Ys in March, ahead of schedule. Furthermore, despite closing down during the extended Chinese New Year on account of COVID-19, its Shanghai factory has been able to attain record levels of production.So, good news, right? Yes, but what lies ahead is more problematic, says Needham’s Rajvindra Gill. The long time Tesla bear reiterated an Underperform (i.e. Sell) on Tesla shares, without suggesting a price target. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)The analyst explained, “Despite the strong numbers, we remain cautious on TSLA's deliveries for the remainder of 2020, as automotive demand has largely collapsed in North America and Europe due to the impact of COVID-19. Moreover, it is unclear when the Fremont factory will be back online, significantly hampering Tesla's production capacity. In the long-term, we continue to expect margin pressure from declining sales of higher-margin Model S & X vehicles (GMs of 25-30%), a lower mix within Model 3, and competitive pressures from other automotive OEMS as they launch their EVs over the next few years.”Overall, Wall Street is not convinced that Musk's tech empire's reward is worth all the risk, especially when taking note that TipRanks analytics exhibit TSLA as a Hold. Based on 28 analysts tracked in the last 3 months, 5 rate a Buy on Tesla stock, 13 maintain a Hold, while 10 issue a Sell on the stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $498.65, marking a slight downside from where the stock is currently trading. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks)"

2020-04-07 09:07:57,Tesla Is Nearing Debut of Longer Range China-Made Model 3,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. plans to expand its lineup in China by offering a locally built Model 3 sedan with a longer driving range from as early as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.The vehicle would have a range of more than 650 kilometers (404 miles) on one charge, compared with about 450 kilometers for the current most basic version that starts at 323,800 yuan ($45,800), the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The variant would start at about 350,000 yuan before rebates, though exact pricing has yet to be decided, they said.A longer range could help Tesla fend off competition from the likes of Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, who are also bringing out new electrified models in China. Carmakers are betting on new vehicles to spur demand in a market hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.The longer-range Model 3, like the existing cheaper version, would qualify for electric-vehicle subsidies and is exempt from China’s car purchase tax.Tesla representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Registrations of Tesla vehicles have fallen for two consecutive months in China, showing the U.S. carmaker isn’t immune to the broader auto-industry slump. The slowdown has come amid Tesla’s multibillion-dollar push to expand in the world’s biggest electric-vehicle market.Yet Tesla’s factory in China has recovered from a virus-related shutdown better than many in the industry, helped by aid from local authorities. After resuming operations on Feb. 10, the Shanghai plant -- Tesla’s only outside the U.S. -- has surpassed the capacity it had before the shutdown, reaching a weekly production of 3,000 cars, the company said last month.(Updates with rival offerings in third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-07 17:37:39,Carmakers Are Showing The World How To Work Together,TSLA,Yahoo,"As COVID-19 is only gaining momentum, more and more hospitals are warning they're experiencing shortages in medical face masks, ventilators, gloves, and other medical equipment. Pictures of nurses at one New York hospital that have been wearing trash bags instead of protective gear have told the whole story of what is going on in the medical supplies market. All of this is happening due to a lack of supplies and a limited number of companies that can produce face masks and protective wear.Consequently, there is chaos in the market. Many deliveries are being diverted from one buyer to another, without any understanding, agreement or mutual consent. The only solution to this problem is to increase the production of face masks and other medical equipment. Carmakers are part of this solution and are showing the way for the world to follow.Chaos On The Medical Supplies Market Last week, German officials accused the U.S. of ""modern piracy"" as face masks that were purchased from the U.S. producer 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) didn't reach Germany after the package was intercepted in Bangkok and returned to the U.S. The Germans interpreted these actions as ""wild west"" methods.Those masks were not delivered due to the invoked Defense Production Act. The Act allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to buy medical equipment it needs by using its authority. It also helps the agency to keep all the necessary medical equipment in the country by limiting or even preventing export. It is quite logical to prevent mask exports, especially when COVID-19 is gaining momentum in the U.S. while at the same time losing its strength in Germany. After all, Germany also imposed similar export restrictions in early March 2020. This is an excellent example of the mess that is unfolding on the medical supplies market. Germans are accusing the U.S. because they did not get the masks they ordered, but anyone can also accuse them of being hypocrites as they have done pretty much the same and only a month ago. But this will not solve the problem. That road leads to nowhere. What we need is cooperation and joint effort so we can produce more protective equipment.Carmakers Showed How The Joint Battle For Lives And Healthcare Should Be FoughtMedical face masks, ventilators, gloves, and other personal protective gear are our biggest weapons against the virus. We need them now more than ever. And we don't have enough of them. It is the root of the problem. But it takes time to gain the necessary know-how and organize an efficient production in order to increase production. The U.S. carmaker General Motors (NYSE: GM) realized this and provided manufacturing blueprints for face mask production. All those blueprints, with detailed specifications materials, equipment, and processes will be available to all companies that want to join the fight against COVID-19. So far, GM has sent production instructions to 600 suppliers willing to join the war. Additionally, last week GM began face mask test production in Detroit. It is expected that up to 50,000 masks will be produced per day, once the production line is running at full capacity utilization.Tesla Is Also Making ProgressTesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) engineers showed their medical ventilator prototype. Its design relies heavily on car parts, but that's not the point. What's important is that Tesla showed to the world that it can count on its contribution. Timeline for production was not specified but nevertheless, these are encouraging news.Volkswagen- A Synonym For SolidarityFinally, German carmaker Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) showed what the word ""solidarity"" means. Recently, it agreed with its interior supplier Faurecia S.E. (OTC: FURCF) to produce face masks and gowns. The supplier's production lines in Mexico were modified and now they are producing masks and gowns. It was announced that its factory is ready to produce approximately 250,000 masks and 50,000 gowns per week. Volkswagen decided to donate its first batch of 75,000 units to New York State hospitals - the epicenter of the crisis. The arrival of this personal protective equipment is expected this week. Cooperation Is The Only Way ForwardThis is how we should all fight this unprecedented health crisis that has put the whole world on hold. We don't need mutual accusations, but cooperation and mutual understanding. Carmakers that are now facing existential problems have shown us the way we all should behave--not to be selfish but human.

2020-04-08 13:45:31,"Tesla Plans No-Pay Furloughs, Salary Cuts While Plants Idled",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. will furlough non-critical employees without pay and temporarily cut executive salaries as much as 30% to conserve cash while the coronavirus pandemic forces the shutdown of much of its operations.In the U.S., those ranked vice president or above will see the steepest salary reductions, followed by a 20% drop for directors and a 10% cut for others, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News. Workers outside the U.S. will see similar reductions. Those who can’t work from home and aren’t assigned critical tasks will stay employees and keep their health-care benefits.The moves add Tesla to the growing number of companies slashing labor costs to weather the pandemic. The outbreak hit just as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk was ramping up the production of the new Model Y crossover, accelerating output at a plant near Shanghai and clearing the way for construction of a new facility outside Berlin.“This is a shared sacrifice across the company that will allow us to progress during these challenging times,” Tesla said in the memo. A representative for the company declined to comment.Tesla shares rose 1% as of 9:45 a.m. Wednesday in New York trading.Reopening PlanTesla agreed to idle U.S. production last month days after authorities ordered the San Francisco Bay area to shelter in place. The electric-vehicle maker expects to resume normal production at its U.S. facilities on May 4, according to the memo, which is the day after the stay-at-home measure is scheduled to end.Even after re-opening its facilities, Tesla will probably need about two weeks to ramp up production again, Dan Levy, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a note late Tuesday. The roughly 30,000 cars that the company had in inventory at the end of the first quarter will be sufficient to meet weakened demand, he said.The company has more than 56,000 employees, according to a recent company-wide email. Its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant is in Fremont, California.Wage adjustments and equity grants will be put on hold, according to the memo. The pay cuts are expected to last until the end of the second quarter, and those furloughed are likely to be asked to return on May 4.Nevada, ShanghaiAt its Nevada gigafactory, Tesla reduced on-site staff by 75%, according to the county where the plant is located. The facility produces battery packs and electric motors with partner Panasonic Corp.Tesla’s Shanghai plant, meanwhile, recovered from a virus-related shutdown faster than many in the industry with the help of local authorities. After resuming operations in February, the factory surpassed the capacity it reached before the shutdown, making 3,000 cars a week, the company said last month.Tesla also is planning to expand its lineup in China by introducing a locally built Model 3 sedan with a longer driving range from as early as this week, people familiar with the matter have said.While Tesla is down significantly from a peak close of $917.42 in mid February, the shares are still up 30% for the year.(Updates with shares trading in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-09 12:32:52,"Tesla Scored Record China Sales In March, Says Industry Association",TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) sold 10,160 vehicles in China in March, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA)- a big leap from the 3,900 vehicles sold in February. This would mark the company’s highest ever monthly sales in the world’s largest auto market.According to Cui Dongshu, CPCA’s secretary general, Tesla sales now account for about 30% of the battery electric vehicles sold in China. Ultimately the company plans to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans from its Shanghai factory.Indeed, Tesla’s $2 billion Shanghai plant recovered from the coronavirus shutdown faster than peers due to local authority assistance. After resuming operations in February, the factory surpassed its pre-shutdown capacity, making 3,000 cars a week, the company revealed last month.Meanwhile Tesla recently decided to furlough non-critical employees without pay and temporarily cut executive salaries as much as 30%.The move is designed to enable the company to conserve funds while the coronavirus pandemic has caused much of its operations to be suspended. According to the company memo, Tesla plans to resume vehicle production on May 4 at its US facilities.Analysts remain divided on the outlook for TSLA stock. According to TipRanks, the stock has received no less than 10 sell ratings in the last three months vs 15 hold ratings ad 5 buy ratings. The $499 average analyst price target suggests shares could pull back over 9%. (See Tesla’s stock analysis on TipRanks)Staying on the sidelines, Baird analyst Ben Kallo reiterated his TSLA hold rating and $525 price target on April 6. Following a study of the 2008 recession, and its impact on vehicle demand, he argued that Tesla “may be underestimating potential longer-term ramifications.”According to Kallo, in 2008 it took ~5 years for peer auto sales to recover to prerecession levels. “That said, we do think TSLA could fare better than luxury peers, with new products/geographies driving growth, a potentially widening EV competitive advantage, and OTA updates keeping vehicles fresh” he added.Related News: Costco Reports Strong March Delivery With $1.5 Billion Sales Bump Disney+ Hits New Milestone With 50 Million Paid Subscribers Starbucks Feels The Pain; Expects 46% Fall In Earnings, Pulls Full Year Guidance More recent articles from Smarter Analyst: * Zscaler Announces Intent to Acquire CSPM Company Cloudneeti * Microchip Boosts Revenue Guidance On Record Bookings * Disney+ Hits New Milestone With 50 Million Paid Subscribers * Six Flags Boosts Liquidity Outlook, Suspends Dividend Payouts"

2020-04-09 14:06:33,The Top 3 Ways to Trade a Pullback in Volatility,TSLA,Yahoo,"Novel coronavirus fear spiralled out of control. States have issued ""stay at home"" orders. Schools closed for the year. Events were cancelled. Flights were grounded. All thanks to a global pandemic that has now affected more than 400,000 people just in the U.S. Fear was so out of hand, the CBOE Volatility Index (CBOE:VIX) rocketed to a high of 83 before falling to a current level around 43.And, at the time, some of the safest opportunities were those I first mentioned on Feb. 27, including the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (NYSE:UVXY), which ran from $20 to a high of $135. The Velocity Shares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NASDAQ:TVIX) ran from $86.50 to a high of $1,000. Even the iPath S&P; 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (AMEX:VXX) ran from $21 to a high of $78.84.Though, at some point, volatility will begin to fall.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 7 Penny Stocks To Buy with Massive Upside Potential When that happens, you want to be well positioned to make money from that, too. Here are the top three ways to do just that.  * Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (NYSE:SVXY)  * VelocityShares Inverse VIX Mid-Term ETF (NASDAQ:ZIV)  * Invesco QQQ ETrust (NASDAQ:QQQ)These three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are the ones to watch. But a word of warning -- some of these funds intend to match the daily results of the index, and holding them long-term can introduce its own volatility. Profit From Volatility: ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY)Expense Ratio: 0.95%, or $95 per $10,000 invested annuallyMy first pick is the SVXY. This ETF was designed to offer one half the inverse of the S&P; 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, daily. Along with the VIX, it was designed to track the changes in expectations for one month in the future.At the moment, the ETF trades around $32 after diving from a high of $67.50. With a good chunk of fear firmly priced into the market, the SVXY ETF could refill a bearish gap around $66, near-term. Of course, plenty of patience is required at the moment.We must also remember that crisis often leads to big opportunity. As even billionaire Warren Buffett will tell you, be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. Baron Rothschild also teaches us to ""buy the blood in the streets."" VelocityShares Inverse VIX Mid-Term ETN (ZIV)Source: Shutterstock Expense Ratio: 1.35%My second volatility pick is the ZIV. This ETN was designed to offer inverse exposure to an index of VIX futures. It seeks -1x the returns of the S&P; 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures for a single day. As volatility decreases, the ZIV ETN will typically push higher.At the moment, the ETN trades around $32 after tumbling from a Feb. 2020 high of $76.47. With a good amount of patience, I strongly believe the ZIV ETN could refill its bearish gap around $75 a share.  * 7 Companies That Deserve to Be S&P; 500 Stocks As even Sir John Templeton would tell investors, ""The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell."" Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ)Another way to trade deflating volatility is by buying the QQQ, which I mentioned on March 25, 2020 as it traded at $185 a share. At the moment, it's up to $202 and could refill a bearish gap around $230 a share with patience.The beauty of the QQQ ETF is that it offers more for less. And most of its top holdings are wildly oversold on coronavirus fears. For less than $200 a share, you're offered exposure to tech companies, like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and dozens more at a steep discount.With a good amount of fear priced in, I strongly believe the QQQ is overdue for a big rally.Ian Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.

It’s got a lot of debt like a car company. So investors can try, can convince themselves all they want, that this is a software company or this is some leading-edge technology company. Sadly, the numbers belie that.”Read more on Chanos being ‘outraged’ private equity giants want aidChanos has been publicly short Tesla for several years. When the electric-car maker was in the process of merging with SolarCity Corp. in September 2016, he said the combined company would be a “walking insolvency.” As Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk was struggling to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan in late 2017, Chanos predicted Tesla was “headed for a brick wall.”Musk acknowledged almost a year later that Tesla had narrowly avoided insolvency, though the company is now on much firmer footing. It’s selling the Model 3 in volumes no other automaker has seen with an electric vehicle, and two quarters of profit sent the shares soaring from late last year through mid February.While the spread of the coronavirus wiped out a fair amount of gains, the stock is still up 37% this year and 125% since Oct. 23, when the company reported earnings for the third quarter of last year.“So far,” Chanos said, betting against Tesla “has not been the correct call, I will admit.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Those firms earlier this week were dealt a setback in their attempt to gain access to billions of dollars of loans that the U.S. government is doling out to help businesses hit hard by the pandemic, Bloomberg reported.Chanos said a look at the year-end letters for the four biggest publicly-traded private equity firms showed they had more than $300 billion in dry powder to put to use.“I think private equity is possibly at a crossroads similar to where hedge funds were post the global financial crisis,” said Chanos, who runs hedge fund Kynikos Associates. “People are going to start to judge the high fees and the illiquidity and think: ‘Am I really getting the return commensurate for the risk?”Apollo Global Management Inc. co-founder Marc Rowan warned in an email to clients, policy makers and government officials written at the end of March that liquidity is evaporating from markets so quickly that the economy will unravel without more support from the Federal Reserve.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-10 05:19:11,Tesla Prices Longer-Range Model 3 to Attract More China Buyers,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. set a price for its longer-range variant of its locally-built Model 3 sedans in China just 13% higher than its entry-level model, a sign that the carmaker is setting competitive prices in order to attract even more consumers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market.The four-door vehicle sells for 366,550 yuan ($52,000) before rebates, according to Tesla’s website, and is designed to have a range of about 668 kilometers (415 miles) on one charge. That compares with about 450 kilometers for the current basic version that starts at 323,800 yuan.After subsidies from the Chinese government and qualifying for exemption from purchase tax, the price of the upgraded Model 3 variant starts at 339,050 yuan. By comparison, the imported equivalent was priced at 439,900 yuan. The longer-range Model 3s are set to be delivered from June.The longer-range electric model could help Tesla fend off competition from other global automakers, including Volkswagen AG and BMW AG and local rivals struggling to sell cars during the coronavirus pandemic. Registrations of Tesla vehicles have declined for two consecutive months in China, showing the U.S. carmaker isn’t immune to the broader auto-industry slump.Tesla also plans to start delivering another variant, a locally-built performance Model 3, in the first quarter of 2021. That will be more expensive, starting with a pre-subsidy price of 419,800 yuan. Final prices will be decided in accordance with state policy upon its official launch, and the product is awaiting state approvals.Thanks to aid from local authorities, Tesla’s factory in China has recovered from a virus-related shutdown faster than many industry rivals. The California-based company’s shipments in China jumped last month to 10,160 units, according to the China Passenger Car Association, though it’s unclear how many of those vehicles were sold to customers as the figure broadly reflects the number of cars leaving the factory.“With the local production of longer-range and performance versions, Tesla has completed local production of all its variants of Model 3 in China,” the company said in a statement, “Tesla is going to push deeper into the Chinese market with a greater variety of products and services.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Zoom is focused on ramping up the security of its application to win back trust and clients it has lost due to privacy concerns, Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan said in an interview with Bloomberg TV this week.On Wednesday, Taiwan instituted a ban on the use of Zoom for official government communications and remote meetings, joining Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. and SpaceX as well as the New York City Department of Education in prohibiting the app. Cybersecurity and privacy concerns were at the root of their actions, and Singapore’s experience with insecure video-conferencing lessons adds to the company’s unhappy record.“We recently changed the default settings for education users enrolled in our K-12 program to enable virtual waiting rooms and ensure teachers are the only ones who can share content in class,” a Zoom spokesperson said. The company is also adding a new “Security” icon to the app’s toolbar for all users, giving quicker access to security features.Read more: Zoom Sued for Fraud As Scrutiny Mounts Over Security Flaws(Updates with Zoom response and other bans from fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

They've stalled factories, furloughed workers and sliced their marketing budgets.Now, they face a new choice: press forward with costly Auto 2.0 projects or push spending to 2021. The pickle puts Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) in a relatively strong position.The Tesla RatingMorgan Stanley analysts Adam Jonas and Armintas Sinkevicius maintained an Equal-weight rating on Tesla with a $440 price target.The Tesla ThesisThe coronavirus has already bought Tesla time on the EV front. General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) has delayed some SUV, truck and sports car launches, and Rivian (which Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has a stake in) has pushed back its R1T and R1S rollouts.""The further along other competitive EV programs get pushed out, the more Tesla will, in our view, be able to extend its competitive edge in electrification from the perspective of the consumer,"" Jonas and Sinkevicius wrote in a note.The analysts expect additional benefits in the autonomous vehicle market, as automakers face a choice between EV projects and AV projects.""We believe budgets will prioritize projects with near-term impact on regulatory costs and payback periods (EVs) rather than longer-term 'moon shots' with a more uncertain path to revenues (AVs),"" they wrote. ""...Either way, we believe this situation overall favors Tesla in the medium term as there would be less competition from higher quality electric vehicles and the disruption could inadvertently help sustain Tesla's premium multiple on the AV front as well.""Morgan Stanley suspects government stimulus is required to support innovation and manufacturing jobs, and automakers will lobby Congress to consider safety technology in its distribution formula. Tesla could disproportionately benefit with its advanced driver-assistance system.TSLA Price ActionTesla shares closed Thursday's session up 4.4% at $573.Related Links:Tesla Furloughs All Non-Essential Workers In The US, Others To Get Pay CutJefferies Upgrades Tesla, Says Company Is 'Doubling Market Coverage With Model Y'Latest Ratings for TSLA  DateFirmActionFromTo  Apr 2020JefferiesUpgradesHoldBuy  Mar 2020Piper SandlerMaintainsOverweight  Mar 2020Morgan StanleyMaintainsEqual-Weight    View More Analyst Ratings for TSLA   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * How Ford, GM And Chrysler Are Producing A New Arsenal To Help Fight COVID-19  * The Tesla Cybertruck Has A New Rival, The Nikola Badger(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The S&P; 500 Index rose 9.3% during the same period.“Coming off its recent first-quarter delivery numbers, which were better than reset Street expectations, there is some clear optimism from the bulls,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote to clients. China production and demand appear poised for a significant rebound and should be a key growth driver over the coming quarter, he said.Even so, it is now a “virtual impossibility” that Tesla will be able to reach its original annual delivery forecast of at least 500,000 units, according to Ives. Bullish investors are also looking past the shutdown of the company’s factory in Fremont, California, which could last at least another month, further complicating the delivery trajectory for the coming quarters, he said.After the coronavirus-related market gyrations that led to as much as a 61% drop in Tesla from a record high on Feb. 19, the stock has been steadily advancing and is currently back to the levels it was trading at around mid-March.Tesla’s 14% rally on Monday also pushed the shares above their 50-day moving average price for the first time since early March.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-14 17:25:48,Tesla Wooed by $1 Billion Missouri Package for Cybertruck Plant,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- A small Missouri city is trying to lure Tesla Inc. with big bucks.The city of Joplin, near Missouri’s borders with Oklahoma and Kansas, is seeking to tempt the electric-car maker with $1 billion in incentives and savings to build a new factory for its futuristic Cybertruck.Joplin is offering Tesla a 1,042 acre site at a 50% discount, according to a website it’s built to court the company led by billionaire Elon Musk. It’s also coaxing the carmaker with a 100% tax abatement for 12 years and various other tax breaks and incentives.The city, which is home to a pair of industrial-battery production facilities, has taken its campaign directly to Musk, with Joplin Area Chamber of Commerce President Toby Teeter appealing to the chief executive officer Monday on Twitter. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment on Joplin’s proposal.Musk, 48, said in a March 10 tweet that Tesla was scouting locations to build the Cybertruck somewhere in the central U.S. In addition to producing the still in-development pickup, the CEO said the factory will make Model Y crossovers for customers on the East Coast.Part of Joplin’s appeal is cheaper labor. The median for hourly earnings in the city is $27.86, significantly less than Austin, Texas, or Nashville, Tennessee, which also may be vying for Tesla’s attention. Joplin says Tesla will be able to save $75 million annually on payroll compared with the manufacturing and engineering wages paid in those other markets.Tesla rose as much as 14% Tuesday after a Credit Suisse analyst upgraded the stock to the equivalent of a hold. The gain extends a seven-day run in which the shares have surged more than 60%.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-15 14:30:47,"Goldman Initiates Coverage On Auto Stocks, Says Industry &#39;Significantly Better Positioned&#39; Than In 2008",TSLA,Yahoo,"Goldman Sachs took a deep dive into the U.S. auto industry, initiating coverage on 10 auto manufacturers and suppliers Tuesday.The Auto Analyst Mark Delaney issued the following auto stock ratings:  * Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) initiated at Buy with an $864 price target.  * Aptiv PLC (NYSE: APTV) initiated at Buy with a $70 price target.  * Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ: GNTX) initiated at Sell with a $19 price target.  * Visteon Corp (NASDAQ: VC) initiated at Sell with a $41 price target.  * Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) initiated at Neutral.  * General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) initiated at Neutral.  * Magna International Inc. (NYSE: MGA) initiated at Neutral.  * Lear Corporation (NYSE: LEA) initiated at Neutral.  * Delphi Technologies PLC (NYSE: DLPH) initiated at Neutral.  * BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) initiated at Neutral.See Also: Tesla's Stock Keeps Rising After Goldman Sachs Gives Shares 4 Price TargetThe Auto Thesis In the initiation note, Delaney said 2020 will be very challenging for the auto industry given COVID-19 supply and demand disruptions. (See his track record here.)Goldman is predicting global auto sales will decline 17% in 2020 and U.S. light vehicle sales will drop 30%. The firm is anticipating those U.S. light vehicle sales will bounce back with 25% growth in 2021.Unfortunately, even with Goldman's auto coverage group down an average of 30% since late January, Delaney said there could be more downside in the near-term given the uncertainty of the pandemic. But Delaney said there is good news for auto investors as well.""Importantly, based on our deep dive work on past cycles, balance sheets, and cash flows, we believe that the companies in our autos coverage are significantly better positioned to weather this current downturn than the one in 2008/2009 (even though we would not currently be buying stocks in the group broadly given the uncertainty about how long the current sharp economic slowdown will last),"" the analyst said.Goldman is most bullish on the EV market and recommends EV leader Tesla and its suppliers as top picks, including Aptiv.Benzinga's Take Like most other industries, the auto industry is a mess at the moment. It's unlikely many customers will be buying cars anytime soon, so the key questions for investors is how long will the downturn last and which companies are best-positioned to weather the slump.Do you agree with this take?

(NASDAQ: TSLA) and chief executive officer Elon Musk must face a lawsuit that alleged Musk deliberately attempted to manipulate the company's stock price.What Happened The lawsuit was filed in 2018 based on Musk's infamous tweet that said, ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""> Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.> > -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 7, 2018""Nothing in the statement suggested it was merely aspirational,"" the United States District Judge Edward Chen said, according to Bloomberg.""It appears factual,"" and according to the complaint, ""was not true,"" Chen added. The petitioners will now have the chance to prove that Musk intended to defraud them or his tweet caused the volatility in Tesla's stock, Reuters noted.Tesla will also need to share evidence with the petitioners, and Musk might face a deposition, as part of the legal proceedings, unless the two parties settle out of court.Why It Matters Following Musk's tweet, the company's shares gained 13% in a day. Short sellers alleged that the tweet was aimed at manipulating the stock price so that the traders who betted on the stock falling would make a loss. Other investors who betted on the stock price rising also faced losses from the uncertainty going forward, as Tesla's chances of going private appeared slim.Tesla and Musk separately settled lawsuits with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $20 million each in relation to the tweet back in 2018. In addition, Musk had to relinquish his role as the company's chairman.He was also asked to seek Tesla lawyers' approval before tweeting on certain topics that could affect the company's stock trading.Nevertheless, Musk got in trouble with the SEC a few months later for another tweet about Tesla's delivery targets.> Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.> > -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2019Price Action Tesla's shares closed 2.8% higher at $729.83 on Wednesday.

2020-04-16 18:09:47,Why Exxon Mobil Investors Should Ignore the OPEC+ Deal,TSLA,INVESTORPLACE,"While a production cut looks good on TV, it really means nothing unless demand miraculously materializes."
2020-04-16 18:09:47,Why Exxon Mobil Investors Should Ignore the OPEC+ Deal,TSLA,Yahoo,"Prior to the historic OPEC+ deal, Saudi Arabia shocked the global community when it engaged in a bitter oil price war with Russia. Naturally, this impacted the U.S. energy markets, particularly oil firms that were already deeply embattled. But the geopolitical rift also took down sector giants like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Fortunately, the much-needed deal made Exxon Mobil stock look much more attractive.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Or did it? While events can change in a hurry, the last few sessions following the agreed-upon production cuts have not been favorable for Exxon Mobil stock nor its key rivals. However, it's fair to point out that Wall Street is steadily digesting all available news. And because we're in unprecedented territory, no one should jump to conclusions based on a few sessions' data points.To further support the optimistic position, U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told CNBC that oil prices may have hit a floor. He believes that the OPEC+ deal has done enough to mitigate the previously disastrous decline.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn paper, Brouillette has a point. When you look at the consumer price index in March for gasoline purchases, the 10.5% month-to-month loss is severe. In the year-ago period, CPI for gasoline increased 5.3%.  * 9 Robust Stocks to Buy to Survive a Bear Market However, the recent downfall is nowhere near the worst that we've experienced. Back in January 2015, CPI for gasoline fell more than 16% month-to-month. Also, in November of 2008, the sector index tanked 31%. That's not to take away from the current crisis. Still, it's important to recognize that we've seen much worse and have recovered.So, does this give the green light for Exxon Mobil stock? Unfortunately, it does not. Exxon Mobil Stock Faces a Demand, Not a Supply CrisisAs I've pointed out in several oil-related stories for InvestorPlace, the crisis facing XOM and other players in the space is related to demand, not supply. Sure, cutting production may help inspire some trading sentiment. Ultimately, though, without consumers running their daily routines, no amount of supply cuts will appreciably change this narrative.Of course, many analysts point to the novel coronavirus or specifically, its economic impact as the biggest headwind facing Exxon Mobil stock. Certainly, with most states imposing stay-at-home orders, the governmental response has done nothing to help the broader oil industries. But that's only one part of the demand equation.In reality, the coronavirus isn't the culprit. Instead, it lit the match on a pool of flammable liquid that was already there for decades.Another indicator that investors should consider before buying Exxon Mobil stock is the CPI for new vehicle purchases. Since the 1990s, the sector CPI has been largely flat. For example, in April 1997, it registered 144.6 points. Last month, it hit 146.3 points.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto Although the CPI isn't a perfect indicator of demand, it gives you a solid idea that Americans have not been willing to pay higher prices for new vehicles. Conversely, they were forced to pay exorbitantly high gasoline prices starting in the early 2000s that did not reflect reality.Therefore, I believe that coronavirus or not, we would have seen oil prices decline. Again, the pandemic has merely accelerated what we're just starting to realize: the erosion of demand for fossil fuels no longer justifies the extreme price thresholds that we saw in gasoline prices.If you're levered heavily to Exxon Mobil stock, you may want to consider trimming your exposure on spike highs. A Virus-Inspired SobrietyPersonally, Exxon Mobil stock is a frustrating investment. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, electric vehicle makers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) supposedly represented an existential threat to XOM. However, I believed at the time that the internal combustion engine had longer legs than EV bulls were giving the platform credit. Thus, I was bullish on the oil giants.However, the outbreak has forced me to reconsider everything. When I did, the data simply does not support the oil industry at this time.  Click to Enlarge Source: Chart by Josh Enomoto I also pulled up the CPI for used vehicle purchases and compared it to gasoline CPI. What I discovered here was that demand for used vehicles has been declining since the 1990s. For instance, in November 1995, used vehicle CPI was 157.8 points. In March 2020, it's down to 138.7 points.Naturally, over the next several months, you'd expect demand for both new and used vehicles to deteriorate. Heck, CPI for all products not related to essentials like food, water and critical supplies should decline significantly. In this environment, it's just not feasible for Exxon Mobil stock to spark and sustain a recovery rally.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies. Over the past several years, he has delivered unique, critical insights for the investment markets, as well as various other industries including legal, construction management, and healthcare. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

2020-04-17 14:55:27,Qualcomm Stock Recovering From Covid-19,TSLA,Yahoo,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is making a rapid recovery from the economic ravages of Covid-19. Things are looking up for Qualcomm stock.Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com While shares remain well below their January peak of $95, they opened for trade April 17 at nearly $77. That's up from a March 22 low of about $61. The market cap is back up to nearly $88 billion, on trailing-year revenue of $24.5 billion. The price to earnings ratio is back up to almost 22.But it's not too late for you to get in. Qualcomm's 62 cent per share dividend, supported by ample cash and earnings, yielded 3.26%. While other companies were eliminating their dividends, Qualcomm has recently raised its payout 5%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  * 9 Asian Stocks to Buy for a Post-Coronavirus Recovery As the economy continues to recover today's Qualcomm stock may look like a great bargain.Or will it? Phones Still WorkQualcomm specializes in communication chips for phones. It dominates the market thanks to an extensive patent portfolio, which it has defended in courts around the world. It has used this dominance to gain a leading position in other mobile phone silicon with its Snapdragon chips.Qualcomm won 36% of the smartphone Application Processor market last year. When such processors included Artificial Intelligence (AI) support, a market that grew 45%, Qualcomm's share rose to 51%.While the roll-out of 5G services has been delayed by the virus, it's still moving ahead. The 5G wave will bring intelligence to everything from traffic lights to heart monitors.Vast new swaths of frequency will be used for Internet-based applications, in both higher and lower frequency bands. Qualcomm is going to get a big share of that money. Qualcomm has already released code support for the silicon it intends to sell. The Threat of the Clouds to Qualcomm StockAs our Ian Bezek wrote recently, Qualcomm stock was hurt during the quarter by the collapse of OneWeb, one of three satellite Internet competitors. It lost out to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) founder Elon Musk's SpaceX and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, which are still moving ahead.That's not the only threat coming from better-heeled competitors. Qualcomm's aggressive defense of its patents, linking purchase of its rights with purchases of its silicon, has created enormous resentment in the clouds. The Cloud Czars, with their $1 trillion plus market caps, are determined to reduce their dependence on Qualcomm.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is already moving toward building its own chips for the iPhone. Now Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has signaled it will do the same, developing chips for its Pixel phones to be made by Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) next year.Fortunately Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now the largest of the Czars by market cap, remains a Qualcomm ally. The two companies were already re-imagining offices when the virus hit.Microsoft calls what it's doing Digital Transformation, combining mobility and mixed reality, delivering artificial intelligence to the edge of networks. This is putting Qualcomm chips inside new kinds of devices like mixed reality headsets. These now look more like sunglasses than the clunky things Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) drew jeers for five years ago. They also have business uses cases, like bringing instructions inside a worker's frame of vision.Qualcomm also has a Chinese card up its sleeve. Having won rights to the China market, it is now working with companies there on things like smart displays. These should keep it on the cutting edge of computing through the decade. The Bottom Line on Qualcomm StockDespite its market cap of $88 billion, Qualcomm is less than one-tenth the size of the companies that now dominate technology.But there is plenty of money in 5G and the Machine Internet for Qualcomm to prosper. The fact that Qualcomm remains committed to its dividend should also keep it a favorite among income investors.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

On Friday, Ross Gerber, president and CEO of GerberKawasaki, joined Benzinga's PreMarket Prep and discussed the ways he said Tesla is benefiting from the COVID-19 outbreak.The crisis has slowed down Tesla's electric competitors, such as Rivian, he said. ""Everybody's stuck on financing, and who wants to throw hundreds of millions into a speculative venture now?"" At the same time, Gerber said General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) are fighting for solvency.""If you go into the bond market today, there's a lot of bonds for Ford and GM you can buy today. A lot of people don't want them,"" he said.Gerber said Tesla's only real competition in the EV market is in China. He said Nio Inc - ADR ADR (NYSE: NIO) is ""garbage,"" but said Geely and BYD are well-run companies.China Loves Tesla Fortunately for Tesla, the company is taking a large share of the Chinese auto market.

It's like a dream car for the Chinese government.""Gerber said China and Europe should drive Tesla to go from selling 380,000 vehicles in 2019 to 1 million vehicles within two or three years.In addition to Tesla, Gerber said he has faith in Gilead Sciences, Inc.

2020-04-18 00:11:32,Got Guts? Get Tesla Stock at This High Valuation; This 5-Star Analyst Remains Sidelined,TSLA,Yahoo,"The past two weeks saw a reversal of fortune for Tesla (TSLA) shares. The stock has rallied 10 trading days in a row, and is up nearly 65%.There’s one reason why investors are particularly bullish on Tesla -- success in Shanghai.Recent drone footage displays recent manufacturing capacity expansion at the firm’s new, highly anticipated Shanghai location. In addition, the plant will be producing and offering a longer-range/deluxe edition of its Model 3 strictly for Chinese customers. This redesigned version is already instilling hype among consumers and, according to Bloomberg, could be rolled out as early as this week. For the tech titan, this international expansion is exciting and rather promising in pursuit of some of its longer-term goals such as gaining foreign market share.However, while all may be well in China, the US is a different narrative. Similar to almost every other large corporation, Tesla is currently having difficulty generating sufficient revenues. So much so, in fact, that the company was unable to pay monthly rent on its premier Fremont manufacturing facility in March. In order to achieve long-term success, Elon Musk disclosed that TSLA “will be reducing [its] monthly rent obligations effective immediately"" without uttering a word of negotiation. The production site has already been closed for nearly a month, and the earliest it could possibly reopen is likely mid-May.For 5-star Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, it’s evident that Tesla currently boasts two very different sides of the same coin. Ives recognizes the fact that although the company is demonstrating efficient mobility into a foreign market and recently beat Q1 delivery guidance, TSLA has nevertheless been unable to pay rent on its main factory and will face serious revenue cuts throughout ensuing months. While Tesla’s long-term goals may still be intact, more uncertainty looms in the near future than ever before.For the time being, it appears that the company’s strengths are outweighing its weaknesses. However, Ives begs to differ, forecasting the stock’s price to be a meager $425 one year from now, which would represent a 45% decline from its current rate. (To watch Ives' track record, click here)Until Tesla’s Battery Day is held and Model Y demand trajectory is announced, both of which will likely occur next month, Ives is staying sidelined on Tesla. Wall Street at-large exhibits a similar consensus. Out of the 29 analysts tracked by TipRanks (in the past 3 months), 6 rate the stock a Buy, while 14 maintain a Hold, and 9 issue a Sell. With an average price target of $520.75, TSLA suggests 31% downside from current levels.

2020-04-20 16:56:58,The Sound Of Electric Vehicles,TSLA,Yahoo,"Have you felt the power of ""Time"" when watching Inception? Did you feel the immense power of ""Now We Are Free"" when watching Gladiator? What about the music from Pirates of the Caribbean, the Batman Trilogy, and The Da Vinci Code?All of that music was composed by the legendary German composer Hans Zimmer. In addition to his film work, Zimmer has also signed on to produce a series of mini-soundtracks to feature in BMW's (OTC: BMWYY) all-electric 2021 BMW i4.The BMW i4 is anticipated to be the first genuine rival to Tesla Motor Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3. Moreover, Hans Zimmer's soundtracks will be setting the tone, and we mean literally, as they will be the sound of all future electric BMWs. In an industry where differentiation is the name of the game, that will definitely set these cars apart from other EV competitors.iSound of EVs - Advantage Or Disadvantage?Unless you own one, do you have an idea what do electric vehicles sound like? At low speeds, both EVs and hybrids can be nearly silent. Surprisingly, in 2011 the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety and Administration found that this makes them more likely to cause low-speed accidents, as pedestrians and cyclists are less likely to hear them coming.To combat this, the EU, known for its stronger push into sustainability, announced that by July 2020 all new electric cars must now be fitted with Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems (AVAS). In order to alert pedestrians, AVAS emit a continuous noise when moving 20 kilometers per hour or slower, as well as when reversing.What About Other EV's?Volkswagen (OTC: VWAGY), owners of the Audi e-tron, has adopted musical chords made from synthesizer sounds that increase or decrease in pitch in correlation to the car's speed.Tesla has yet to incorporate music into its cars, though Elon Musk recently spoke about enjoying electronic music on a YouTube stream. Will that be the direction of the Tesla sound? This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-04-22 13:22:00,"BofA Downgrades Tesla, Says Company &#39;Faces Several Hurdles&#39;",TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla shares traded higher on Wednesday despite one Wall Street analyst downgrading the stock and questioning its valuation.The Tesla Analyst Bank of America analyst John Murphy downgraded Tesla from Neutral to Underperform and cut his price target from $500 to $485.The Tesla Thesis Murphy updated his outlook for the entire auto industry on Wednesday, calling for messy first-quarter results, including a 24% drop in global production and an 11% drop in U.S. production. For the full year, Murphy is projecting global production volumes will drop 23% compared to 2019.Earlier this month, Tesla reported 88,400 first-quarter vehicle deliveries, up more than 40% from a year ago. Despite a global health crisis that has crippled the auto industry, Tesla shares have rallied 67.5% year-to-date in 2020. Tesla shut down production at its factory in Fremont on March 23 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the production shutdown, the stock is up 61.4%.Murphy said Tesla remains an electric vehicle trailblazer.""However, Tesla faces several hurdles, including: 1) ongoing/future production challenges, 2) spike/ burnout pattern for new models, 3) continued losses/cash burn from low production/deliveries, elevated cost, and new facility construction, and 4) the prospect of new competition and technology/model obsolescence,"" Murphy wrote in the note.He said Tesla's current valuation suggests the market isn't fully appreciating the company's near-term risks.Benzinga's Take Many of Tesla's critics aren't bearish on the company's growth trajectory and instead focus on the stock's valuation. Tesla's market cap is now $126 billion. The peak Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) market cap back in 1999 was $80 billion, while the peak General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) market cap of all time was $66 billion in 2017.Do you agree with this take?

(NASDAQ: TSLA) has appointed Hiromichi Mizuno to serve on the board and its audit committee.What Happened Mizuno's appointment to the automaker's board came into effect as of Thursday. He previously worked as executive managing director and chief investment officer of Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), which manages $1.5 trillion in assets. Mizuno placed emphasis on ""environmental considerations in portfolio management,"" according to Tesla's statement.The automaker acknowledged that its newly appointed director is known to challenge ""many established market practices,"" including short-selling ""to promote long-term value creation by corporations."" Tesla stated, ""We are excited that Hiro has joined our mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.""Why It Matters Tesla CEO Elon Musk, expressed his support for Mizuno when he halted stock lending from its $400 billion foreign equity portfolio, for short-selling purposes. Musk tweeted his appreciation, ""Bravo, [the] right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal.""Musk has had a running battle with short sellers on both Twitter and the media, and he once described them as ""Jerks who want us to die."" He also said, ""They're constantly trying to make up false rumors and amplify any negative rumors. It's a really big incentive to lie and attack my integrity. It's really awful.""The Japanese executive has a broad array of international business and government experience, which spans the World Economic Forum's Global Future Council, PRI, an investor initiative that works with the United Nations, and the Japanese government's strategic fund integrated advisory board.According to Tesla's SEC filing, Mizuno's compensation would include 2,778 shares of Tesla's common stock, vesting, and exercisable on June 18, pending continued service. For his role as a member of the audit committee, he will be awarded 4,000 shares of Tesla's common stock, vesting in 12 equal tranches, assuming continued service on each vesting date.

The shares had closed the regular session 3.62% lower at $705.63.See more from Benzinga  * UAW President Says Talks Ongoing With GM, Ford, Chrysler On Restarting Auto Plants  * Trump Signs Executive Order Halting Immigration to US  * South Korean Economy Registers Steepest Contraction Since 2008 Financial Crisis(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Kallo reiterated his neutral rating on Tesla stock in a note discussing the timeline for production to restart at Telsa's plant in Fremont, California. ""We will look for updated commentary on a timeline for restarting production, but do think the company is positioned to manage ~2 quarters of downtime,"" said the note. Kallo estimates Tesla's cash burn for the first quarter at about $400 million, after it produced about 14.3K more cars than it delivered; the corresponding inventory build could be an overhang, he wrote. ""All else equal, we think the inventory build alone could be a ~$500M headwind (inventory valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value),"" he wrote. ""That said, the inventory build will likely enable TSLA to continue delivering cars despite production downtime in Q2, which we view favorably.""

2020-04-24 21:08:24,The Benefits Of Electric Vehicles Are Clear As Day,TSLA,Yahoo,"The one thing half of the world is not doing these days is traveling. Or ""going"" to work. Half of the world's population is in self-quarantine as part of the effort to contain the spread of COVID-19. And the world's largest automakers have literally pushed the brakes as they halted production and this includes the Big 3 automakers: General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), Fiat Chrysler (NYSE: FCAU) as well as Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and even Tesla Motor (NASDAQ: TSLA), whose CEO dismissed coronavirus concerns only a month before slashing employee pay and closing its California plant.World leaders are on the same page now- COVID-19 is no joke. But although it will slow down the economy dramatically, the coronavirus will not stop the EV era that is upon us once the world gets back to normal.EVs vs. Traditional Combustion VehiclesWhen it comes to maintenance, electric cars win the race against vehicles with internal combustion engines. They are also mechanically simpler than gas-powered cars.There is no more need for an elaborate maintenance schedule and the effort to have a good technician, as Tesla routinely improves its vehicles using over-the-air software updates.In a way, you can even say that all Tesla owners need to do is wash their cars regularly and wait around for over-the-air software updates to keep their vehicles in tip-top condition.Another upside is that there are no oil changes. Putting it simply, no-engine oil. These vehicles are almost fluid-free. They do infrequently require a filter change and door hinges still need to be lubricated. But the bottom line is that the electric drivetrain is almost fluid-free.Also, there is no need to replace the brakes every 50,000 miles because Tesla uses regenerative braking, pads and rotors, which makes them subjected to less wear. Owners can expect to change pads every 100,000 miles.The Downside To EVsThere is the topic of the largest and most expensive component, namely the battery replacement. This is the one area where gas-powered vehicles have a slight advantage. A new Tesla battery is rather pricey between $5,000-7,000, whereas a whole new motor could end up being $3,000 or if you're luckier, a new gas tank would be around $1,000.Also, the aluminum construction of Model S and X make it very expensive to repair accidents. However, the Model 3 and Model Y cars moved away from a pure aluminum body to more of a mix with other alloys, which should make them cheaper to repair.OutlookThere's really no debate: electric cars outperform traditional combustion engine vehicles in terms of both the environmental impact as well as the total lifestyle economic cost.Still, there are some areas of maintenance that Tesla and its EV peers should work on. And as competition intensifies, these limitations will surely be conquered. This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

2020-04-25 00:40:07,Tesla Escalates Battle Over Alleged Theft of Robocar Secrets,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- More than a year after the billionaire chairman of Xpeng Motors labeled as “questionable” Tesla Inc.’s allegations that an engineer stole Autopilot secrets before bolting to the Chinese startup, the questions from Elon Musk’s company keep coming.As Tesla tries to amass proof in its lawsuit portraying the engineer as a traitor, it’s asking a judge to force the Guangzhou, China-based maker of Tesla look-alike electric cars to disclose its autonomous-driving source code, turn over images of computer hard drives and even make an employee available for an interview.Tesla is also demanding information from an ex-Apple employee criminally charged in 2018 with trying to take secrets for a new job with Xpeng. Tesla claims it’s significant that both engineers sought jobs with Xpeng around the same time and allegedly used the same “difficult-to-trace” method -- Apple Airdrop -- to take sensitive files from their American employers.Xpeng, which isn’t a defendant in the suit, and the two engineers all have denied wrongdoing. Xpeng and the former Apple engineer are resisting Tesla’s demands for more information, calling them improper intrusions in court filings.“Tesla’s latest demands crossed the line, seeking to rummage through our IP on Tesla’s terms -- and smearing us along the way with misrepresentations and innuendo,” a spokesperson for Xpeng’s U.S. research arm, XMotors, said in a statement. Tesla’s attempt to tie the two Chinese engineers together is “peddling speculation and stereotypes,” according to the statement.Hearings on Tesla’s subpoenas are set for May in San Francisco federal court.Tesla to Apple: Help Us Nail Robocar-Secrets Thief at China FirmXpeng, which is backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., is among the startups in China competing with Tesla on autonomous-driving development in the world’s most populous country. Tesla last year opened a multibillion-dollar plant near Shanghai -- its first outside the U.S. -- and plans to open a design and engineering center in the country.‘Flow of Talent’Tesla says at least five of its former employees have gone to Xpeng, whose full name is Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co. Ltd. One was hired in 2017 by the startup as vice president for autonomous driving and supervised the self-driving research-and-development team through 2018 and 2019. When Xpeng’s chairman, He Xiaopeng, reacted in March 2019 to Tesla’s lawsuit, he said Xpeng and Tesla are innovators and that the “flow of talent” between companies is normal.Tesla argues the parallels between the defection of its engineer and Apple’s are close enough that it’s entitled to an explanation as to whether they worked with the same recruiters at Xpeng, met with the same executives at the Chinese company and received similar compensation.“The greater the similarity between the two cases, the less likely that those similarities can be dismissed as mere coincidences, and the more likely that they are the result of planning and coordination,” Tesla said in the filing.Questionable NarrativeBut at least one part of the narrative laid out by Tesla raises questions about how it’s portraying the evidence.Tesla said its former employee, Guangzhi Cao, was paying attention in July 2018 when news broke that the former Apple engineer, Zhang Xiaolang, was arrested in the San Jose, California, airport as he was about to board a one-way flight to China. In an April 17 court filing, Tesla quotes Cao texting to a friend about the arrest that Xpeng and Zhang must have “agreed on the price before to get the documents.”However, according to a log of Cao’s texts that was filed as a court exhibit, it was the friend who initiated the conversation about the arrest and who sent the quoted text message.Cao wrote in one text that the Apple engineer’s arrest “has made a bad impression for all Chinese people” and in another “Glad I did not go to Xiaopeng, so risky,” according to the log.Tesla didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.Denying MisconductCao has acknowledged he downloaded some of Tesla’s source code on his iCloud account and his personal devices, but said he deleted those files before he left the company and maintains he didn’t commit misconduct, according to court filings. Cao’s attorney couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Zhang, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that could send him to prison if he’s convicted, contends that forcing him to turn over the documents that Tesla seeks would undermine his constitutional right against self-incrimination. An attorney for Zhang declined to comment.Xpeng said in a filing that it’s already assisted Tesla voluntarily and in response to a prior subpoena served on XMotors, including by turning over a forensic image of Cao’s laptop and more than 12,000 documents. The U.S. carmaker’s latest demand for information doesn’t change the fact that there’s no evidence that any Tesla trade secrets were passed on to Xpeng, the company said.“Tesla’s overreach and distortions confirm this is just a fishing expedition meant to bully and disrupt a young competitor,” the XMotors spokesperson said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-25 22:19:07,Tesla Is Calling Some California Plant Workers Back Next Week,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is calling some workers back to its lone U.S. vehicle-assembly plant starting next week, before San Francisco Bay area stay-home orders are scheduled to expire.Supervisors told some staff in the paint and stamping operations of the factory in Fremont, California, to report to the facility on April 29. In messages seen by Bloomberg News, plant leaders ask workers to reply and say whether they plan to show up.Tesla representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla had previously communicated to workers that it expected to resume normal production at its U.S. facilities on May 4, the day after Bay area health measures are slated to end. The electric-car maker clashed with Fremont officials last month over whether its factory was an essential business or otherwise needed to shut down to comply with an Alameda County order issued in mid-March.The Fremont plant builds every vehicle currently in Tesla’s lineup -- the Model Y, 3, X and S -- and last produced cars on March 23. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimate that the factory’s shutdown has been driving about $300 million of cash burn per week.When Tesla was resisting calls to idle the factory last month, Fremont officials sought clarification from Alameda County as to whether the company was an essential business. Erica Pan, the county’s health officer, considered the plant to be a public health risk, according to documents obtained through a California public-records request.Debate over how soon it will be safe for auto companies to reopen their factories is now dividing the industry. While carmakers including Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. have said they intend to restart operations early next month, the United Auto Workers union has said that’s too soon and too risky for its members, who work for General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and other manufacturers.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The company had previously said that it planned to resume normal operations on May 4, a day after the Bay Area's shelter-in-place order is scheduled to be lifted.  Tesla supervisors told some staff in the paint and stamping operations at the California factory to report to the facility on April 29, the Bloomberg report https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-25/tesla-is-calling-some-california-plant-workers-back-next-week?sref=y3YMCJ4e said."
2020-04-26 06:19:46,Tesla Plotting Restart At California Factory Next Week,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) is planning to ask some employees to return to work at its factory in Fremont, California from next week, according to a report by Bloomberg. This request comes before the end of San Francisco’s lockdown period, where stay-at home directives are still in place due to Covid-19.In fact, San Francisco Mayor London Breed revealed on April 24 that it ‘is very likely’ that the stay-at-home order could be extended past the current May 3 expiration date in the Bay area ‘by a few weeks or even a month.’According to the Bloomberg report, supervisors asked staff from the Fremont factory’s paint and stamping unit to return to work on April 29. They then told workers to confirm if they intend to turn up for work on that date or not.Given that the expiration date of the lockdown is May 3, Tesla had previously required workers to return on May 4- when the plant was supposed to begin normal production again.The closure of the plant in the first place was a controversial point for Tesla, with analysts from Credit Suisse calculating that the shutdown was costing the electric-car maker approximately $300 million per week.Tesla shares have exploded by 73% year-to-date, but the rally has left some analysts cautious that the stock has moved too far, too fast. TipRanks shows that TSLA scores a Hold analyst consensus with a $518 average price target- indicating downside potential of over 25%. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks).However Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently initiated coverage on TSLA with a buy rating and Street-high $864 price target (19% upside potential). Although he accepts that the shutdown of Tesla’s Fremont factory will weigh on 2020 results, Delaney nonetheless sees Tesla as “the clear market leader in electric vehicles (EVs) in terms of battery range and market share.”Related News:  All Eyes on Apple’s Q2 Earnings Next Week  Is Google Squaring up for a Fight With Amazon?   Lam Research’s Solid Customer Demand Sparks Multiple Buy Ratings More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * Domino’s Pizza Sees U.S. Comparable Sales Boost, Suspends Outlook   * Peloton Shares Spike on Record Participants in Live Streaming Cycling Class   * Apple Prepares to Sell Macs With Its Own Chips in 2021   * Valero Maintains 7.5% Dividend Yield, Assuaging Investor Concerns"

2020-04-28 18:54:31,Tesla Q1 Earnings Preview: Analysts Convinced Of Long-Term Potential Ahead Of The Print,TSLA,Yahoo,"First-quarter expectations for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) are understandably muted, but the sell-side is sold on the long-term prospects for the EV maker.Tesla is scheduled to report its financial results Wednesday after the market close.The Tesla Analysts Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas maintained an Equal-Weight rating on Tesla with a $440 price target.Wedbush analyst  Daniel Ives  maintained a Neutral rating and $425 price target.Analyst-turned-venture capitalist Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. Investors Willing To Look Beyond 2020, Morgan Stanley Says Tesla investors are focused on two things, its full-year unit guidance and the cash burn for the quarter, Jonas said in a note.Investors are bracing for unit deliveries of 400,000 for the year, the analyst said.Jonas said he expects the company to lower its full-year guidance given the unprecedented environment, which is atypical of the company.If the company takes the guidance down to a coronavirus-adjusted 420,000-450,000, investors would react positively, given the implication that a second-half recovery is in the offing, he said.The buy side is estimating cash burn of $500 million for the quarter, the analyst said. With investors discounting a bad first quarter and a weak second quarter, any commentary on forward demand, China ramp and visibility for aprod uction re-start are likely to be the real needle movers, according to Morgan Stanley. ""Overall, we found sentiment to be strongly positive with the majority of investors willing to look beyond 2020 and focus on the long term trajectory of the company and its exposure to the rapidly growing secular trend of EVs and AVs,"" Jonas said. View more earnings on TSLASee Also: Tesla's Stock Keeps Rising After Goldman Sachs Gives Shares 4 Price TargetChina A Key Growth Driver, According To Wedbush Hitting the original 500,000-plus unit delivery threshold for 2020 looks virtually impossible as Tesla navigates through a challenging COVID-19 sales environment that has temporarily closed its  Fremont factory  and forced the company to announce furloughs and salary cuts, Ives said in a note. The analyst said he expects China production and demand, which have significantly rebounded, to serve as a key growth driver over the coming quarters.""While cash burn will be heightened in the near term due to this anomalous near term global situation, we believe the longer-term trends remain very healthy and $20 of annual earnings power down the road is achievable,"" he said. Investors are also likely to focus on details around Tesla's upcoming battery demand trajectory for Model Y, and any further insights/granularity on the linchpin China market, according to Wedbush. Long-Term Tesla Opportunity, Munster Says Tesla's earnings report is likely to reveal the following, Munster said in a blog post:  * Free cash flow missing estimates.  * The company doing away with the June quarter delivery guidance in the wake of the uncertainty.  * Positive order trends entering the pandemic. Munster also expects the company to talk of favorable pre-order trends for its Model Y and Cybertruck vehicles. With Fremont shut for 33 days, the Street is bracing for a sharp decline in June quarter deliveries, Munster said.Yet June quarter deliveries could surprise to the upside by coming in flat or only slightly down from the previous quarter, he said. Munster sees a sliver lining in the factory shutdowns, as he said they could give the company time to upgrade the Fremont production lines, expand Model Y capacity and improve manufacturing efficiencies.""We believe the long-term Tesla opportunity is intact and well-positioned when the world returns to 'normal,'"" Munster said. ""With an expanding product line, Tesla should continue to gain auto market share, growing 15-25% faster than the overall auto industry for multiple years.""TSLA Price Action Tesla shares were trading lower by 2.98% at $774.95 at the time of publication Tuesday.Photo courtesy of Tesla.

2020-04-29 21:40:53,Tesla Soars After First-Ever Quarterly Profit to Start Year,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares surged after the carmaker reported its first-ever quarterly profit to begin a year, but it burned through cash again and backed away from guidance for how the rest of the year will shake out.Adjusted net income of $227 million, or $1.24 a share, and revenue of almost $6 billion beat analysts’ average estimates. Tesla’s stock -- already the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index this year -- soared as much as 11% after the close of regular trading.The advance Elon Musk has engineered by producing and delivering more cars than expected early this year has positioned the chief executive officer to receive the first set of stock options from a pay package that set moonshot goals two years ago. Investors are overlooking uncertainty about how soon the company will be able to resume production at its sole U.S. vehicle-assembly plant in California, where authorities have extended a stay-home order to the end of May.“It is difficult to predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and its global supply chain will return to prior levels,” Tesla said in its quarterly update. “Due to the wide range of potential outcomes, near-term guidance of net income and free cash flow would likely be inaccurate. We will again revisit our 2020 guidance in our Q2 update.”During the debut quarter for the new Model Y crossover, automotive gross margin improved to 25.5%, the highest in a year and a half. While Tesla stopped short of restating its forecast for deliveries to “comfortably” exceed 500,000 vehicles this year, the company said it believes it can achieve industry-leading operating margins and profitability.“Gross margin was mostly the thing that sticks out to me on the positive side,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird with the equivalent of a hold rating on Tesla, said by phone. “On the question-mark side, I have to wonder why they didn’t talk about demand at all.”While Tesla suspended production at its factory in Fremont, California, last month, it managed to build about 14,000 more vehicles than it handed over to customers in the quarter. Inventory build-up led the company to burn through about $895 million in cash during the period. Tesla still ended March with $8.1 billion on its balance sheet after raising money through a stock offering in February.Musk, 48, will postpone initial deliveries of Tesla’s Semi truck again to 2021 -- roughly two years later than initially planned -- as the company prioritizes starting output of the Model Y crossover in Shanghai and building a factory in Germany where it aims to begin shipping cars from in the middle of next year.Tesla boosted profits in part by increasing revenue from regulatory credits to $354 million. That’s up 64% from a year ago and more than double the sales in the fourth quarter.“Tesla investors are looking past the June quarter,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst who rates the stock a hold, said by phone. “The bulls could take this and run.”(Updates with gross margin in the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-04-30 16:33:33,Tesla Beats the Street but One 5-Star Analyst Says ‘Sell’,TSLA,Yahoo,"Electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA) takes its place as one of the most controversial names on Wall Street; either you love it or you hate it. However, even the company’s naysayers can’t deny it's on a roll recently, with its stock up 98% year-to-date and delivering a surprisingly solid first quarter performance.During its most recent quarter, Tesla reported earnings on gross margin that flew past the consensus estimate, with OpEx also coming in well below expectations. Looking specifically at its Shanghai plant, the company believes Model 3 production will achieve a rate of ~4,000 cars per week (~200,000 per year on a run rate basis) by mid-2020 thanks to robust progress at the site. It should be noted that in the first quarter, only the Standard Range Plus version of the Model 3 was produced in China. However, in April, the Long Range and Performance Model 3 versions were added to the lineup.Writing for Needham, five-star analyst Rajvindra Gill expanded on this, noting, “...the gross margins of China-produced Model 3s mirrors those produced in Fremont. Gross margin is expected to further improve on lower manufacturing costs. Partially offsetting this is TSLA's decision to reduce the price of the Standard Range Model 3 in China starting May 1 to qualify for government subsidies on EVs.”Adding to the good news, Model Y vehicle production in Fremont has been ramping up since January of this year through the use of new production lines as well as shared capacity with Model 3. After kicking off deliveries of higher-ASP Model Y variants during the quarter, gross margin landed in the green. Not to mention Tesla has been bumping up capacity for Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Shanghai, with deliveries slated to begin in 2021.That being said, these positive developments weren’t enough to convince Gill to join the bulls.“Given the uncertain macro environment, TSLA declined to give N-T profit guidance or reaffirm its prior guidance of 500K deliveries in '20. Thus, we remain cautious on TSLA's performance for the remainder of 2020, as automotive demand has largely collapsed in the US and Europe due to the impact of COVID-19,” Gill explained.Especially concerning for the analyst, though, is the closure of its factory in Fremont due to the county-wide shelter-in-place order. While the plant was originally supposed to reopen on May 4, this date was further delayed. As a result, Gill thinks the shutdown will have a significant effect on Tesla’s second quarter earnings, with management also declining to provide near-term earnings and free cash flow guidance.Gill added, “In the long-term, we continue to expect margin pressure from declining sales of higher-margin Model S & X vehicles (gross margins of 25-30%), a lower mix within Model 3, and competitive pressures from other automotive OEMS as they launch their EVs over the next few years.”To this end, Gill left an Underperform call on the electric car company, while declining to set a specific price target. (To watch Gill’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts are also cautious when it comes to Tesla. 6 Buy ratings, 10 Holds and 10 Sells add up to a Hold consensus rating. At $595.15, the average price target brings the downside potential to 28%.

2020-04-30 16:57:50,"Tesla Analysts Break Down Free Cash Flow, Fremont Shutdown, 2020 Expectations After Q1 Print",TSLA,Yahoo,"Despite the chaos in the world around Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), the automaker reported a strong first quarter Wednesday, with sales of $5.985 billion exceeding a $5.9-billion Street forecast and a bottom line of $1.24 far surpassing expectations of a 36-cent loss.The performance was driven in part by early Model Y deliveries and a 40% year-over-year increase in total deliveries. Additionally, Tesla notched a 9% increase in Model S and X production, a 39% increase in Model 3 and Y output and its first weekly production of 1,000 solar roofs.While Tesla said that global Model Y production will stay on schedule, it postponed Semi deliveries to 2021 and put a hold on near-term profitability.Tesla's Financials Bank of America applauded the company's outperformance in revenue per unit and gross margins, while Wedbush highlighted 20.6% GAAP gross margins ""that [speak] to a business model which has significantly lower costs and more production efficiency.""""This level of profitability is key for the bulls and it speaks to a business model which is staying out of the red ink despite this unprecedented COVID-19 dark storm,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note. GLJ Research focused on Tesla's free-cash-flow generation, noting the company ""returned to form"" with its burning of $895 million. Loup Ventures reflected more positively on the metric.""Free cash flow would have been positive if not for the inventory rebuild,"" Gene Munster wrote. ""Tesla had negative free cash flow of $895 million, but inventory growth accounted for $981 million. The biggest reason for the increase in inventory is that the pandemic-induced shutdown resulted in postponing the end-of-quarter delivery surge.""Tesla's regulatory credit revenue also caught analysts' attention. BofA Securities estimated that the source contributed about $1.11 per share -- the majority of the bottom line -- while GLJ Research found that, by excluding the revenue, Tesla's auto gross margins fell sequentially from 20.2% to 18.4%, with a GAAP loss of $338 million.Overall, GLJ remains skeptical not only of Tesla's financial stability but of its accounting quality. ""How is it possible for TSLA to report lower OPEX in 1Q20 vs. 4Q19 when it was operating 2 multi-billion dollar auto plants in 1Q20 vs. just one in 4Q19, and why does Tesla, as its CFO admitted yesterday, pay current quarter payables in the forward quarter (thus, seemingly artificially boosting its current quarter cash balance),"" analyst Gordon Johnson wrote.Tesla's Operations CFRA and Needham took note of Tesla's silence around the restart of the Fremont factory. Management stalled the plant on March 23 and intended to reopen on May 4, but the Bay Area extended a shelter-in-place order to the end of May.""We expect the extended shutdown of the Fremont plant, which produces the majority of their vehicles, to have a significant impact on TSLA's 2Q results,"" Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote.GLJ Research emphasized Tesla's European market share decline from 37.2% to 25.3%.Forecasts For Tesla BofA said there's little visibility into the second quarter, but expects the period to be the hardest of the year.""[COVID-19] may disproportionately hit TSLA by derailing its ongoing capacity/production expansion across its plants,"" analyst John Murphy wrote. View more earnings on TSLA""Beyond disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain skeptical that TSLA has sustainably turned the corner on profits and cash flow, and rather believe that further growth will be accompanied by additional income and cash flow volatility.""While it sees no potential for Tesla to hit its goal of 500,000 deliveries this year, Wedbush is more optimistic about the coming quarters than BofA. ""Although the rest of the world is essentially shutdown and in lockdown mode, strong Model 3 demand out of China remains a ray of light for Tesla in a dark global macro,"" Ives said. Johnson said he expects Tesla to burn $2.4 billion in free cash flow this quarter given the burn rate in the prior quarter. ""With Tesla back to its old ways of incinerating cash, despite the most competitive backdrop the company has ever experienced looking into 2H20, following what we believe will be a $3 billion to $4 billion capital raise over the coming weeks, following by multiple capital raise attempts through 2020, we maintain a (very) negative bias,"" he wrote.By contrast, Loup views the next 18 monthly positively and expects Tesla to capitalize on a variable cost dynamic.While positive on Tesla's China opportunity, Needham expects long-term margin pressure from competition and declining sales of high-margin vehicles.""We remain cautious on TSLA's performance for the remainder of 2020, as automotive demand has largely collapsed in the US and Europe due to the impact of COVID-19,"" Gill wrote. CFRA is staying on the sidelines and attributed its stance to a lack of visibility on the Fremont restart and a doubling in Tesla's share price. ""Perhaps the most prudent move TSLA could make is to complete another equity issuance to further bolster liquidity and fund future plant construction, although this seems unlikely after it completed a $2.3B stock offering in February,"" analyst Garrett Nelson wrote.

2020-04-30 21:03:45,Tesla Declines After Einhorn Questions Musk’s Accounting,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares closed 10% below their intraday high after hedge fund manager David Einhorn publicly questioned Elon Musk again over the electric-car maker’s accounting practices.Einhorn, who five months ago told Musk he was “beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist,” said Tesla had claimed in the past that its balance of money owed was elevated by sales being highly concentrated at the end of each quarter. The Greenlight Capital president questioned how that could have been the case at the end of March given the shutdowns that Musk, 48, excoriated on Wednesday.“Can you or Zack explain?” Einhorn, 51, wrote in a tweet to addressed to Musk and referring to Tesla’s chief financial officer, Zachary Kirkhorn. Einhorn also asked how the company’s automotive margins “barely budged” despite production disruptions, the cost of ramping up the new Model Y and other factors.Tesla shares closed down 2.3% after erasing an intraday gain of as much as 8.7%.Tesla disclosed in a regulatory filing Thursday that one unidentified entity represented 10% or more of its accounts-receivable balance as of March 31. The contribution was related to sales of regulatory credits, the Palo Alto, California-based company said.Revenue from the emissions credits Tesla sells to other automakers surged to $354 million last quarter, a sum that exceeded the company’s $227 million adjusted net income. The maker of the Model 3 sells credits to manufacturers who need them to comply with environmental standards that are getting stricter in most markets around the world.Read more: Carmakers go from shunning EV bets to fueling Tesla profitEinhorn built his reputation by challenging the accounting practices of lender Allied Capital starting in 2002, which paid off along with his prediction that Lehman Brothers would fail before the bank went bankrupt in 2008.But betting against Tesla has been less productive, with the shares having tripled in the past year. Musk has taunted Einhorn by claiming he’d send a box of short shorts and host a tour of the carmaker’s facilities. The CEO apparently hasn’t followed through on the idea.“I guess the offer of a factory tour was never serious,” Einhorn said in his latest tweet.(Updates with stock ending the day down in headline and third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-05-01 17:34:34,Elon Musk Is Right About Tesla&#39;s Stock,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- So what do we call Elon Musk’s latest? Funding unsecured?That was enough to send Tesla Inc.’s stock plunging by as much as 13% on Friday, a cool $18 billion or so. One imagines those analysts who gushed about the peanut-sized profits announced all of two days ago are racing to update their models. In a way, the CEO’s tweet does a service, emphasizing once again that Tesla’s stock price is an emotional, not financial, construct.It’s also a kick in the teeth for investors. In February, Tesla sold $2.3 billion of new shares at $767 apiece. When Musk put thumb to touchscreen on Friday, the “too high” stock was trading at about $761. I guess the assumed discount rate must have changed or something in the intervening two months or so. It should have, obviously, given the Covid-19 pandemic piling more risk onto Tesla’s already less-than-utility-like model. Indeed, much as Musk’s “funding secured” debacle in 2018 coincided with his frustration about short sellers and Tesla’s struggles with the Model 3, this week’s antics come at a time of increased stress.Wednesday’s earnings call was going rather well — by its peculiar, stage-managed standards — until Musk created a storm by declaring disease-related lock-downs to be “fascist.” While that may reflect a deep libertarian streak, such a stance would seem at odds with running a business that has relied on billions in subsidies and is now expanding in China. Possibly, it reflects anxiety about what the continuing suspension of activity at Tesla’s main factory in California means for cash flow.I had suspected Tesla might soon seek to raise more capital to offset that risk. In a way, a lower price would help with that. Although you also have to wonder how underwriters could square the risk of the CEO intervening suddenly to crater the stock price. On the other hand, everyone somehow learned to live with his earlier, similar intervention pushing it the other way.Once again, we must ask where the board stands on all this. Tesla revealed earlier this week that Musk will provide directors and officers liability insurance for a year after regular insurers quoted “disproportionately high premiums” for some unfathomable reason. It is a peculiar, and yet distinctly Teslarian arrangement, with Musk embedded at the center as both risk factor and underwriter. Friday’s bizarre episode fits the mold perfectly.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

2020-05-01 21:53:56,Tesla Falls as Musk Says Stock Too High in 2018-Style Tweets,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares plunged after Elon Musk said the electric-car maker’s stock is too high in a stream of tweets reminiscent of the posts that securities regulators sued him over in 2018.The chief executive officer posted more than a dozen times in a span of less than a 75 minutes Friday, claiming he’s selling “almost all” of his physical possessions and won’t own a house. He also renewed his call for reopening the economy.Hours later, Tesla’s head of human resources for North America told employees that furloughs will be extended at least another week. The carmaker’s shares fell 10% to close at $701.32.Musk, 48, told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he wasn’t joking and his tweets weren’t vetted before he posted them. Tesla’s stock is still up 68% for the year, an advance that’s put him in position to meet the final performance threshold he needs to receive stock options that would yield a windfall of about $730 million.Read More: Musk Is on the Cusp of Getting a $730 Million Award“We view these comments as tongue-in-cheek and it’s Elon being Elon,” Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst with a hold rating on Tesla, said in an email. “It’s certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot-button issue.”Musk’s Twitter burst followed a profane rant during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. He railed against shutdown orders aimed at containing the coronavirus, telling analysts he was worried about not being allowed to reopen the company’s assembly plant in Fremont, California. He compared shelter-in-place measures with forcible imprisonment.Earlier: Musk Decries ‘Fascist’ Shutdown Orders“Musk is frustrated, and he has a pattern when he’s under pressure to turn to Twitter,” Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, said by phone. “It’s his form of therapy. But he also has an agenda, which is to get the Fremont factory back open.”Tesla’s environmental, health, and safety team has been working “non-stop” on procedures to facilitate the return to work, Valerie Capers Workman, the North American human-resources chief, said in an email to staff seen by Bloomberg News. San Francisco Bay area counties this week extended their stay-home orders through the end of May.In December, Musk joked about Tesla’s stock being “so high” when it climbed above $420. That’s the price at which he said Tesla would go private in 2018, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said he picked the number to make a marijuana-related joke that would impress his girlfriend.On Friday, Musk said his girlfriend, the musician Grimes, is now mad at him. They have a baby due on Monday, he wrote.Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million to settle the securities-fraud lawsuit the SEC brought in September 2018 over the CEO’s tweets claiming that he had the funding to take Tesla private. But the dispute carried on into last year after Musk posted that the company would make roughly 500,000 cars in 2019 without advance approval from a Tesla lawyer.The two sides amended their earlier agreement that aimed to set limits on his tweeting by adding specific topics that Musk isn’t supposed to post about without pre-approval. The subjects include the company’s financial condition, potential mergers or acquisitions, production and sales numbers, new or proposed business lines, projections and forecasts that haven’t been previously published, and Musk’s purchase or sale of Tesla securities.While Musk’s statements may have run afoul of the SEC agreement, the agency might not reopen the case against him, according to Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman who now leads the advisory firm Kalorama Partners.“The SEC has bigger fish to fry,” Pitt said in a Bloomberg Television interview.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysMusk’s opinion probably falls within the subject matter that must be preapproved by a securities lawyer. Yet there’s an argument that the opinion is based on past results.\--Holly Froum, BI litigation analystClick here for the researchMusk has made similar comments before about Tesla’s stock being overvalued. In May 2017, when Tesla had a roughly $50 billion market capitalization, the CEO said it was higher than the company deserved.“We can only guess at motivations behind his sequence of tweets,” Ben Kallo, a Robert W. Baird analyst, said in a note to clients. He has a $700 price target for Tesla’s stock but warns there could be “significant uncertainty over the next 2-3 quarters” regarding the company’s efforts to restart production.When asked if he was selling his possessions because he needed cash or was protesting, Musk responded the answer was neither. He’s long sought to reach Mars with his rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and is devoting himself to that effort, and to the Earth, he wrote.(Updates to embed new tweet after the fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-06-15 11:45:31,BP Submits to Brutal Reality on the Future of Oil,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- BP Plc’s potential $18 billion writedown underscores just how significant a turning point 2020 is becoming for the oil industry. It baldly acknowledges that the major hydrocarbon producers are sitting on oil fields that will never be developed — because the pandemic has curbed energy demand and increased the desire for renewables within the supply mix.The British oil giant has a new chief executive officer and a new finance director and it was already trying to break with the past before the impact of the Covid-19 crisis became fully apparent. The outbreak has prompted a more radical reassessment of BP’s future role and what its assets are worth.BP’s assumption is that the long-term price of Brent crude will be about $55 per barrel, up to 30% lower than it thought previously. Among its oil major peers, the company’s management is shifting from the bullish to the bearish group. On that basis, some fields won’t earn adequate returns, and some of the world’s fossil fuels that would have been extracted and burnt now won’t be.It’s a moment to be compared not only with peers’ comments of late, but with the seismic revaluations the industry has inflicted on investors over the past two decades — think ConocoPhillips’s $34 billion of asset impairments in the financial crisis.The shift partly reflects the near-term reduction in economic activity. Energy demand is driven by gross domestic product and that’s expected to be sharply lower this year and next. BP also sees the pandemic accelerating the move to cleaner forms of energy as policymakers look to restart economies using less conventional energy, pushing up the cost of emitting carbon.Equities may have recovered from their lows on the expectation that many countries are returning to work. But oil stocks have not, and manufacturers such as Tesla Inc., squarely focused on the transition to cleaner forms of power, have sharply outperformed.Altogether, this hopefully begins to address the economic conundrum that has hampered the energy transition: the relative competitiveness of dirty and clean energy. The higher returns from putting another dollar into the development of conventional energy assets have simply been too tempting for oil majors to allocate serious funds to renewables. It may be some time before the returns BP makes from clean energy can compare with those from oil. Perhaps it can make a virtue of diversification, offering large business clients energy from multiple sources in a way that combines security of supply with an increased proportion of renewable provision.For now, the immediate impact on BP of the writedowns will be to weaken its balance sheet by inflating gearing, which measures net debt as a percentage of total capital. This was 36% at the end of the first quarter (against a long-term target of 20% to 30%). How significant this is will depend on the view of the credit-rating firms. But the pressure to lower leverage will be intense. That, in turn, forces a rethink of BP’s generous dividend.A few weeks ago, CEO Bernard Looney was unapologetic about maintaining the payout amid the pandemic, suggesting the board would wait and see how the crisis developed. The contrast between that message and the hard conclusions aired on Monday couldn’t be more stark.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering deals.

2020-06-15 13:03:57,Tesla’s China Car Registrations Jump In May; Stock Down In Pre-Market On Analysts’ Rating Cuts,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc.’s (TSLA) China car registrations in May jumped 150% month on month, Reuters reported citing data from auto consultancy LMC Automotive.The U.S. electric vehicle maker’s China registrations, including imported cars, grew to 11,565 in May from 4,633 units in April.Data from the China Passenger Car Association shows sales of Tesla’s Shanghai-made Model 3 sedan hit 11,095 units in May.Still, shares in Tesla continued to fall in Monday’s pre-market trading declining another 3.4% to $903.45 after dropping 3.9% on Friday. Meanwhile, year-to-date the stock has more than doubled.Last week’s start of a downward trend was triggered by two rating downgrades from analysts at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas lowered his rating on the stock to Sell from Hold with a $650 price target (31% downside potential) amid concerns about U.S.-China trade dynamics as well as recent price cuts of some of the car maker’s models.Jonas believes that Tesla’s recent rally, doesn’t adequately reflect the potential for a deterioration in U.S.-China trade relations that could ""disproportionately"" impact Tesla relative to other automotive companies.Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy, citing its high valuation.“We’d look to become more positive on Tesla stock again if we had more confidence in the near to intermediate term trajectory of fundamentals, or if valuation became more attractive,” Delaney wrote in a note to investors.TipRanks data shows that the stock has Hold analyst consensus with 11 Sells and 9 Holds versus 8 Buys. Meanwhile, the Street’s $632.45 average price target implies 32% downside potential in the shares over the coming year.

On Monday, S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said Nikola is rapidly approaching what could be a major short squeeze. Dusaniwsky said Nikola has already accumulated $526 million in short interest, about 5.2% of its float.In addition to taking an aggregate $244.5 million loss on their positions so far in June, Nikoa short sellers are also paying stock borrow costs that topped 600% on Monday, according to Dusaniwsky.At this point, S3 estimates Nikola short sellers are paying about $3.6 million in borrow costs per day just to maintain their positions.""With significant mark-to-market losses and skyrocketing stock borrow fees NKLA is prime target for a short squeeze,"" Dusaniwsky said.The only auto stock that has cost short sellers more money in June is Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).Benzinga's Take: Nikola short sellers likely see the company's valuation as even more egregious than Tesla's.

2020-06-16 00:24:36,"Is Tesla Bigger Than Toyota or Not? Well, It’s Complicated",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Last week, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk liked a tweet that read, “Tesla is now officially the most valuable automaker of all the world!! Congrats!!”The tweet showed a screenshot of a well-shared Google sheet created by Reddit user u/brandude87, listing the world’s top 25 automakers by market value. The sheet showed Tesla above Toyota Motor Corp. for the first time, with a market value of $183.7 billion versus Toyota’s $178.78 billion.There’s just one problem: many investors, including those using financial data terminals such as Bloomberg’s, were seeing something very different: that Tesla still had to gain more than $25 billion dollars in market value to surpass Toyota.So who was right? Well, it’s complicated.Everyone can agree that a company’s market value, or its market capitalization, is determined by the amount of shares outstanding multiplied by its share price. But not everyone agrees on what should be counted in those shares outstanding.In recent years, Japanese companies have been expanding share buybacks to boost their returns to investors -- and they have a tendency to hoard these shares, with Toyota, which has been aggressively repurchasing its own stock over the past six years, holding more than any other company in Japan.Known in financial parlance as treasury stock, how the shares are accounted for varies from country to country. Some markets forbid holding of treasury shares entirely, while others have capped the amount that can be held.When it comes to Japanese-listed companies, treasury shares are typically included in quoted market cap figures. And when a company as valuable as Toyota holds as much as of its own shares as it does -- just over 14%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- that can have a big impact on market capitalization.A ranking of companies by market value published monthly by Tokyo Stock Exchange operator Japan Exchange Group Inc. shows market capitalization including treasury stock and lists Toyota’s market value at the end of May as 22 trillion yen ($205 billion) -- a figure which included almost $30 billion in treasury shares.Tesla Closing In on Toyota Market Value Spurs Celebration, DoubtExcluding those holdings, it’s only worth 18.8 trillion yen ($175 billion), according to Bloomberg calculations. That matches what you’d find on portals such as Yahoo Finance -- the source of the calculations in the tweet Musk touted. Many calculations of market cap, including those of U.S.-listed companies, typically don’t include treasury shares, which aren’t considered available to investors.Tesla, meanwhile, holds no treasury shares. What’s the right apples-to-apples comparison if you’re trying to determine which is the world’s largest automaker?“It’s semantics,” said Nick Reece, a money manager at Merk Investments. “Market cap can be defined in different ways. It depends on what you’re trying to get at.”After a 6% jump in trading on Monday in the U.S., Tesla’s $183.8 billion valuation was above Toyota’s $175 billion valuation, less its treasury stock.The amount of treasury shares held by Toyota has doubled since 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company periodically uses portions of them for executive compensation plans or, most recently, selling some of them to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. as part of a tie-up.“I guess the treasury shares have some value as far as accounting treatment is concerned,” said Michael Shaoul at Marketfield Asset Management. “But I think you could exclude them in a market cap comparison as long as you made it clear that they exist.”In any case, perhaps it’s not the right comparison to be made between a company that has made an average of more than 2 trillion yen ($18.7 billion) in net income for each of the last six years, and one that has yet to post an annual profit.“There isn’t a single person who thinks that simply because Tesla’s market cap has come close to that of Toyota, that Tesla is a company that is on par with Toyota,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo.“However, if you look 10 years down the road and factor in extreme expectations, $1,000 a share or $1,100 may be appropriate.”(Adds link to related story, updates market values throughout)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-06-16 11:00:27,"When Stocks Are This Stormy, Don’t Rock the Boat",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the U.S. stock market is giving you whiplash, you’re not alone.Perhaps this sounds familiar: Your portfolio was sprightly when the year began, as U.S. stocks extended their stellar gains from 2019. Friends called to crow about their profits on Tesla’s surging stock, urging you to get in. You wondered if you had too little invested in the market. Then the nightmare began. Stocks sold off sharply in late February on coronavirus fears. Your portfolio melted. Even the stocks you thought were a sure bet — Microsoft, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet — tumbled from their perch. On second thought, maybe you had too much invested in stocks. You see where this is going. A month later, the market suddenly turned higher. Seemingly every stock shot up in late March, including shares of the airlines, cruise lines and casinos you thought were headed for bankruptcy. Now you wonder how you could have missed a historic buying opportunity. Among the masses of tortured investors is renowned money manager Stanley Druckenmiller. The first ballot hall-of-famer has amassed a multibillion-dollar fortune by deftly navigating markets for decades, but not even he has been able to wrangle the market’s recent gyrations. He told the Economic Club of New York last month that “the risk-reward for equity is maybe as bad as I’ve seen it in my career.” Then, last week, he appeared to change his mind, telling CNBC that he’s been too cautious. “I was up 2% the day of the bottom, and I’ve made all of 3% in the 40% rally,” he said. “I missed a great opportunity.”It’s not the first time Druckenmiller has been tossed around by an unruly market. He bet against internet stocks in February 1999 during the dot-com madness. A month later he had lost $600 million and his portfolio was down 15% on the year. So he started buying them instead and was up 35% by the  end of the year. Encouraged by the easy money, Druckenmiller plowed an additional $6 billion into tech stocks in March 2000. The bubble burst just days later and he lost $3 billion. “I already knew that I wasn’t supposed to do that,” he recounted later. “I was just an emotional basket case and couldn’t help myself.”  The lesson is that no amount of intelligence, learning or experience is foolproof when the market is stormy. And by any measure, the market’s moves in recent months have been extraordinary. The S&P; 500 Index plunged 34% from Feb. 19 to March 23. Since 1928, the first year for which daily prices are available, only the Great Crash in the fall of 1929 and the subsequent selloff in the fall of 1931 produced deeper losses over the same number of trading days. The ensuing run-up has been just as unusual. The S&P; 500 surged 44% from March 23 to June 8. Only 1932 and 1933 produced larger gains over the same period.    And there may be more breathtaking swings on the way because Covid-19, the market’s chief nemesis, doesn’t appear to be going away. After trending down for weeks, the U.S. has experienced an uptick in new coronavirus cases in recent days. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee last week that more fiscal stimulus will be needed to support American businesses and families. Perhaps not coincidently, the S&P; 500 dropped 6% last Thursday, the biggest one-day decline since March 16, and is down 5% since its recent peak on June 8. More ominously, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, the most widely followed gauge of expected market volatility, is up roughly 50% since the beginning of last week. So what to do? The best way to avoid big mistakes in a roiling market is simply to stick with your investment plan. For example, if you rebalance your portfolio to a predetermined mix of stocks and bonds once a year, as many investors do, leave it alone until the next rebalance and don’t look at it in the meantime. Watching the market’s hysterical and arbitrary daily fluctuations during a crisis does nothing for your portfolio — never mind your health. When the time comes, muster the courage to rebalance back to your target stock/bond mix. If the market is down, it will force you to buy more stocks at lower prices, which should provide a boost when the market eventually recovers. And if you don’t yet have a plan, sit tight. You’re more likely to make a bad decision when the market is in turmoil. When things calm — yes, this bout of volatility will pass and probably sooner than you think — there will be plenty of time to formulate a plan ahead of the next crisis.   It also helps to keep an eye on the longer term. Anything can happen in the market in a day, week, month or even year. But over longer periods, the range of likely outcomes diminishes and the probability of a good outcome increases significantly. Since 1926, the worst one-year return for the S&P; 500 was a negative 68% from July 1931 to June 1932, including dividends, and the best one-year return was 163% during the following 12 months. Over rolling 10-year periods, however, the worst return was negative 5% a year and the best was 21% a year. And over 20-year periods, the worst and best outcomes tightened further to 2% and 18% a year, respectively.  That’s why Wall Street firms often agree on the long-term outlook for the S&P; 500, even as their price targets for any given year vary considerably. UBS, for instance, estimates that U.S. large-cap stocks will return 5.7% annually over the next several years, while JPMorgan pegs the number at 5.6%. In the near term, however, UBS estimates that the S&P; 500 will close the year at 2,850, whereas JPMorgan sees it climbing nearly 20% higher to 3,400 during the first half of 2021, according to estimates tracked by Bloomberg.But who cares what happens to stocks during the next year? There’s no way to know or control what the market will do in any given year, and most investors are in the market for years or decades. Those who manage to tune out the noise along the way are likely to have an easier and more enjoyable investing experience — and very likely fatter profits, too.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

It was reported to have reduced the prices of a majority of its vehicles in the United States and China last month.Why It Matters The status of the long range Model S 400 miles has long been a point of contention between Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and the EPA.Musk, at the earnings call for the first quarter in April, said the long range model had already achieved the 400-mile range, and that the EPA left the door open with the key inside the car that drained 2% of the battery, Electrek reported at the time.

(OTC: PCRFY) under which the Japanese battery maker will manufacture and supply lithium-ion battery cells at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada.What Happened The agreement was signed June 10, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tesla made Tuesday.

(TSLA) said it has signed a three-year pricing agreement with Panasonic Corp. for the manufacturing and supply of lithium-ion battery cells at the Gigafactory Nevada.The agreement effective from April 1 until March 31, 2023, sets the specific terms between the two parties with respect to pricing, planned investments and new technology. It also determines production capacity commitments by Panasonic and purchase volume commitments by Tesla over the first two years of the agreement. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.The new agreement builds on previous deals between Tesla and Panasonic related to the production and supply of lithium-ion battery cells. In November 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million in a private placement of Tesla common stock.In addition, Tesla also signed an amendment to the company’s general terms and conditions of its 2014 partnership agreement with Panasonic, which modifies the term to expire 10 years after Panasonic achieves certain manufacturing milestonesThe U.S. electric vehicle maker has last week been reportedly given the green light by the Chinese government to build model 3 vehicles in the country equipped with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Tesla is said to be in advanced talks to use LFP batteries from CATL that contain no cobalt - one of the most expensive metals in electric vehicle (EV) batteries - in cars made at its China plant.The value of Tesla shares has this year more than doubled. The stock retreated less than 1% to close at $982.13 on Tuesday.Five-star analyst Ben Kallo at Robert W. Baird this week reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $700 price target, citing a recent management meeting.""Sentiment was positive across our meetings; investors appear increasingly willing to look through near-term noise and focus on future (2021+) revenue and earnings growth drivers,” Kallo wrote in a note to investors. “This is reasonable, in our view, given the numerous projects underway which could meaningfully contribute to growth over time. Nearer term, the upcoming Battery Day and subsidies in Germany were areas of focus.""In line with Kallo’s outlook, the stock has a Hold analyst consensus with 11 Sell ratings and 9 Hold ratings versus 8 Buy ratings. Meanwhile, the Street’s $649.95 average price target implies 34% downside potential in the shares over the coming year.

""The Street was bracing for bad news around US Model 3 sales during the height of the lockdown in April and May and this morning the band-aid got ripped off,"" the analyst said. The state is Tesla's ""core sweet spot"" and expectations of a decline in deliveries have been reflected in Wall Street reducing Tesla delivery forecast to roughly 400,000 from around 550,000 before the coronavirus pandemic. Investors turn to ""the trajectory in the month of June and especially into the core summer months heading into fall in hopes of a rebound as (the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif.) enters 2H,"" Ives said. Growth in China is offsetting some doom and gloom in California numbers, the analyst said. Strong Model 3 demand in China ""remains a ray of shining light for Tesla in a dark global macro and appears to be on a run rate to hit (100,000) unit deliveries in the first year"" of Tesla's Shanghai factory, he said.

2020-06-17 17:23:14,Tesla Analyst Says Plunging Registrations In Key California Market Pushing Street Delivery Estimates Down,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) sales momentum faltered during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the temporary closure of its Fremont, California factory.What Happened:  Registrations for Tesla cars in California plunged 37% year-over-year in the April-May period, the  Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday,  citing Dominion Enterprises' Cross-Sell report.After declining 16% in April to 6,260 new vehicles, registrations plunged 70% to 1,447 in May, the report said.This compares to the 52% decline in industrywide registrations for each month.The weakness is not specific to California, with the report stating that across 24 states tracked by Dominion, Tesla car registrations fell 33% to 14,151 in the first two months of the quarter compared to the 45% drop for the broader industry, the Journal said.The numbers account for about 65% of the automaker's markets in the U.S.The COVID-19 impact and dark macro backdrop are hurting Tesla sales in its ""core sweet spot"" of California over the past few months and have been instrumental in the Street lowering its deliveries forecast for 2020 from 550,000 pre-coronavirus to roughly 400,000, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a Wednesday note. Why It Matters:  California is Tesla's key market in the U.S., and going by the weakness relayed in other markets, the company could be in for a sales shortfall in the second quarter, the Wedbush analyst said. ""Domestically speaking California remains a linchpin to Model 3 success for Tesla and now all eyes shift to the trajectory in the month of June and especially into the core summer months heading into Fall in hopes of a rebound as Fremont enters 2H,"" he said. Tesla's  sales rebounded  nicely in China in May from weak performance in the previous month. China is the ""happening market"" for Tesla given the market opportunity there, Ives said. Tesla sells domestically made Model S cars in China.The key to Tesla's stock remains the staggering China growth rebound, which is important for the company to hit the goal of 1 million delivery vehicles annually in a few years, the analyst said.This, along with potentially ""game changing"" battery innovations, is driving shares higher heading into the company's likely Battery Day event in the next few weeks, he said. Wedbush sees a rebound occurring over the coming months, with the lockdown easing and the ""Fremont Stand-Off"" in the rearview mirror.Wedbush maintained a Neutral rating on Tesla with a $1,000 price target.

2020-06-17 21:15:15,"The Electric Car Battery Boom Has Screeched to a Halt, For Now",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Three decades of advances took lithium-ion batteries from powering handheld Sony camcorders to propelling Tesla’s popular electric vehicles. The rapid rise is facing a major test in the Covid-19 pandemic.Demand for rechargeable batteries will decline for the first time this year, as sales of electric cars—the biggest user—slump with novel coronavirus pummeling the auto industry, according to BloombergNEF forecasts. Battery shipments to carmakers are forecast to fall 14% in 2020, and the effects of the slowdown are seen lingering into next year.Major producers, including South Korea’s LG Chem Ltd., a supplier to Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co., have cut annual sales forecasts. Analysts expect the industry’s planned vast expansion of manufacturing capacity to slow down. Startups burning through cash as they work on potential breakthrough technologies are bracing for a tougher sell to secure funds.And yet, from Silicon Valley laboratories to China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the world’s top producer, optimism over the lithium-ion battery’s longer-term outlook is undimmed. Batteries, say automakers and utility companies, are still on track to become more powerful, cheaper and ubiquitous, not just in passenger vehicles, but also in additional forms of transport, consumer electronics and large-scale energy storage.Despite short-term pressures, Zeng Yuqun, chairman of CATL, said there is “great confidence in the long-run.” In less than a decade, his company has grown to lead its industry: CATL’s sales rose 90% in 2019, according to BloombergNEF.Lithium-ion battery demand has more than doubled since 2015 and remains on track for about a ninefold expansion from last year to the end of the decade. The sector is also forecast to keep lowering costs. Battery prices plunged 87% in the past 10 years, pushing plug-in electric cars to near sticker-price parity with gas guzzlers.The pandemic might even prove to be an opportunity, with at least some governments, including those of Germany and France, using virus recovery funds to help accelerate a transition from internal combustion engines to battery-powered alternatives. France will offer about 8 billion euros ($9 billion) to its auto sector to bolster support for electric vehicles; Germany’s stimulus package includes about 5.6 billion euros for the sector and will require gas stations to install charging units. “This is a historic plan to confront a historic situation,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on May 26.There are other sources of optimism. Volkswagen AG on June 16 announced an additional investment of $200 million in QuantumScape Corp., a battery technology startup founded by former Stanford University researchers, after committing $100 million in 2018. In May, the carmaker became the biggest shareholder of Chinese battery producer Guoxuan High-Tech Co. Ltd.“The train’s left the station on both renewable power generation and electric vehicles, and no one is going to put that train in reverse,” said Jeff Chamberlain, chief executive officer of Volta Energy Technologies, a Chicago-based fund focused on energy investments. Chamberlain previously led energy storage initiatives at the Argonne National Laboratory,  the U.S. government facility seen as having been pivotal in the transfer of battery technology from academia to the auto sector.Battery makers also are quickly making progress on three key fronts: battery life, power and cost. CATL recently announced it will soon begin production on a battery that can operate for 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles), or about 16 years. The capability puts it far ahead of any of the batteries on the market today, which typically are under warranty for about 150,000 miles, Zeng said.Tesla and GM are each developing batteries that can last a million miles. Neither have yet said exactly when they’ll be ready. GM is “almost kind of there on longer life,” Doug Parks, an executive vice president, said at a May 19 Citigroup Inc. event. The car maker is “experiencing nearly that in some of our products today,” Parks said.Combustion engine vehicles are currently scrapped in the U.S. after about 200,000 miles, Tesla said in a June 8 report, meaning a longer-life battery pack could dramatically extend a car’s lifespan, particularly useful for taxis or delivery trucks. More important, a million-mile pack could be resold by a consumer to be deployed in a second vehicle, offsetting some of the initial purchase price.Tesla is planning to provide further details on its battery innovations in the coming weeks at what it’s billing as a “battery day” investor seminar. It had tentatively been scheduled for April but was delayed on account of Covid-19 travel concerns and restrictions.One critical update investors are expecting: the average cost of batteries used in Tesla’s various models. The carmaker’s numbers typically set the standard for others to catch up to, and the car battery still accounts for about 30% of the total cost of an electric vehicle. Better technology and rapid growth in manufacturing capacity has already sent the price of lithium-ion batteries tumbling, down from more than $1,000 a kilowatt hour to an average of $156/kWh at the end of 2019, according to BNEF.An industry average battery price of $100/kWh, should be achieved in 2024, BNEF analyst James Frith said at a seminar in May, leading to price parity between electric cars and combustion engine vehicles. Additional savings through 2030 will lower costs further, though they’ll prove harder to achieve and will depend on additional advancements and new technology, according to Frith. Every battery has three key components: two electrodes, cathode and anode, with an electrolyte—usually a liquid—to allow the battery to charge and discharge.A key, pending breakthrough will be the addition of silicon into battery anodes in place of graphite. California’s Sila Nanotechnology Inc., which counts Daimler AG among its investors, says the silicon will help make a single charge last at least 20% longer.The technology is being applied to consumer devices that are due to hit the market next year, said Sila CEO Gene Berdichevsky. There’s also potential for the technology to make its way into some supercars or luxury vehicles as early as 2023—and mainstream vehicles after that, Berdichevsky said. “There's now more engineering resources at the battery makers that we work with,'' he said. “There's more capacity on the production line to try new things.""A more significant advance could be achieved before the end of the decade via the commercialization of solid-state lithium-ion batteries for regular cars. Such a development would enable smaller battery packs, reducing safety risks and dramatically improving energy density, allowing cars to travel much further on a single charge.Solid-state technology does away with the liquid electrolyte, replacing it with a material such as ceramic, glass or polymer. Toyota Motor Corp., the leader in development of the technology, is on track for commercialization in the first half of this decade, the company said.Colorado-based Solid Power Inc. has started shipping its solid-state batteries to prospective customers in the auto industry for testing. The startup is likely to face a challenges in securing funding, while its products go through the years-long process of verification. The batteries won’t be available for purchase before 2025,  if the company is able to navigate through the current economic downturn.“I’d be lying if I said raising capital in the near term is not going to be challenging,” said Doug Campbell, Solid Power’s CEO.Those able to withstand short-term pressures should benefit from a demand wave that’ll make about 31% of the world’s passenger cars—about 500 million—battery-powered by 2040, according to BNEF.There’s also rapid growth coming from two-wheelers such as motorbikes and scooters, as well as in large-scale energy storage. Above Moses Lake, Washington, last month, the maiden flight of a converted, all-electric Cessna plane pointed to an additional potential source of demand.It’s a long-term outlook that’s offering the battery industry reassurance. With parts of California under shelter-in-place restrictions, the board of Sila Nanotechnology, which includes General Electric Co.’s financial crisis-era leader Jeff Immelt, met last month via videoconference to consider how best to handle a pandemic-led downturn.“They said: Keep going, be thoughtful in your investments, but keep investing,’’ Berdichevsky said. “Now is not the time to stop.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Es una iniciativa municipal que busca impulsar la siembra comunitaria en la zona y que ademas otorgara permisos a privados y laboratorios que previamente cuenten con la habilitacion del Anmat.Los motivosEl intendente de Villa Ciudad Parque, Pablo Riveros, hablo con la agencia de noticias estatal Telam sobre las motivaciones y objetivos de esta reforma: al parecer, en el pueblo de Cordoba, hay 15 familias (sobre un total de 3500 habitantes) que dependen del cannabis medicinal para tratar enfermedades cronicas diversas tales como la epilepsia.Tambien es una manera de reactivar la economia y generar puestos de trabajo en una region que, viviendo principalmente del turismo, se vio devastada por la pandemia de COVID-19.

Potencialmente, incluso se utilizan desde hace cientos de miles de años. La evidencia concreta mas temprana consiste en murales grabados en roca que representan iconografias de hongos, encontrados en el norte de Australia. Lxs arqueologxs y geologxs sugieren que estas ilustraciones con temas psicodelicos se remontan al 10.000 AC. Si bien no hay evidencia solida que respalde este uso temprano, es logico suponer que lxs humanxs han consumido hongos psicoactivos desde que el homo sapiens se volvio evolutivamente distinto.Esta premisa es logica por dos razones:En primer lugar, muchas otras especies buscan activamente y consumen sustancias psicoactivas. Ejemplo de esto son los renos de Siberia y America del Norte que comen hongos Amanita Muscaria. O los delfines que ingieren el veneno psicotropico del pez globo. O los jaguares que consumen la vid, la raiz y la hoja de la planta alucinogena Caape.En segundo lugar, los hongos de psilocibina pueden encontrarse en todos los continentes habitables. Por lo tanto, los primeros hominidos que se aventuraron fuera de la jungla a la sabana y mas alla, seguramente los vieron y probablemente los consumieron. Asi, sin darse cuenta, es probable que hayan logrado una ventaja evolutiva a traves del mayor estado de conciencia provocado por los hongos.Continua leyendo este articulo: Hongos Psicodelicos: Una Historia DefinitivaSexo y CBD: Menos Dolor y Mas Placer, segun Encuesta Por WeedMaps.El CBD se entrelaza con el sexo de formas ultramodernas.Una creciente lista de compañias de salud cannabica, como Foria, Quim, 1906 New Highs y Privy Peach, han llevado los versatiles usos del cannabidiol (CBD) a la cama.

2020-06-18 22:25:58,$68 million tax breaks may go to put Tesla plant to Austin,TSLA,https://www.newstimes.com,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - An Austin-area school district is considering offering more than $60 million in tax incentives to attract a proposed Tesla ""gigafactory"" to Central Texas, Tesla revealed Thursday. 
 The Del Valle Independent School District proposal was made public in a Tesla tax application filed Thursday with the Texas comptroller's office. The proposal would offer Tesla $68 million in property tax breaks over 10 years to put its new plant on a 2,100-acre (85-hectare) site off Texas 130 just north of the Colorado River on the southeastern outskirts of Austin. Travis County commissioners are considering a separate tax incentive package. 
 The comptroller's documents state the real value of the property would average about $600 million per year. Without the Del Valle district incentives package, Tesla would have to pay almost $8 million in property taxes per year. 
 Austin is competing with Tulsa, Oklahoma,  to become the city that hosts the plant that build's the Cybertruck, Tesla's planned electric pickup truck, and the Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle. In its application with the Texas comptroller's officer, Tesla says it is considering the Travis County site and a site or sites in Oklahoma. 
 The proposed plant would have 4 million to 5 million square feet (370,000 to 465,000 square meters) of space and would be Tesla's biggest so far. Tesla's U.S. vehicle assembly factory in Fremont, California, employs 10,000 workers. 
 In its Thursday filing, Tesla said that if the Del Valle school board approves the incentive package and it proceeds with building on the Travis County site, construction could start in the third quarter of this year and take two to three years to complete.

In short, shares may be worthwhile as a speculative buy--at a lower price. SPCE Stock and the RivalryI find the Branson-Musk rivalry to be the most interesting part of the ""Billionaire Space Race.""You could say Elon Musk took Branson's adventurer-entrepreneur shtick and ran with it. Like Branson, Musk parlayed his business success into full-fledged celebrity status. A few decades back, Branson was the larger-than-life business tycoon the press loved to write about. Today, it's Musk in the spotlight, playing that same role.However, this ""changing of the guard"" may not apply to their respective space companies.As InvestorPlace's David Moadel wrote that, SpaceX's recent headline-grabbing doesn't help or hurt the fortunes of SPCE stock. Elon Musk's space exploration company may be making much progress. But both companies are a long way off from turning space tourism dreams into reality.Granted, Virgin Galactic's May rocket launch was a bust, but this company's success isn't going to happen in a matter of months. Or years, for that matter. It could take a decade for this company to scale into a profitable enterprise. Considering space tourism may be a multi-billion dollar industry by the 2030s, that means big potential for both Virgin and SpaceX.However, this may not mean it's time to buy shares today. Virgin Galactic may still have strong prospects. But, as Branson and other insiders unload shares, do you really want to be on the other side of the trade? Should You Care Branson's Selling Virgin Galactic Stock?As I wrote last month, Sir Richard Branson may have to sell Virgin Galactic stock in order to save his business empire. Branson only intends to unload 25 million shares. But, as this commentator noted earlier this month, a total of 150.5 million previously-restricted shares have been freed up. In other words, other insiders/large shareholders can unload SPCE stock onto the public markets.It remains to be seen whether markets have fully absorbed this development. If Branson is forced to sell more shares, or if other insiders unload some of their position, the stock could fall below its current price level.But, insider selling shouldn't be your only concern with this name. As our own Matt McCall wrote May 26, the company's massive cash burn remains a major risk. In order to keep the lights on, this company will likely need to raise more cash via an equity offering. That would dilute current shareholders, reducing their potential share price upside.Yet, don't write off SPCE stock completely due to these factors. Shares right now seem pricey, when weighing risk against opportunity. However, if shares continue to dip, the risk/return proposition may improve. Sit Tight for Now, But Be Ready To PounceAt first glance, Virgin Galactic stock looks more like hype than a strong investment opportunity. Firstly, the space tourism market is at least a decade away. Secondly, Musk appears to be eating Branson's lunch, given that SpaceX, not this company, is making the most headway. Thirdly, and most importantly, insider selling, coupled with massive cash burn and dilution risks, makes this stock look like a hard pass.Yet, this company is still in its early stages. There's plenty of time to get in on the ground floor. If shares fall back into the single-digits, consider a small position in SPCE stock. It'll still be a moonshot, but with sufficient upside potential.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis since 2016.

2020-06-19 13:41:37,It’s Finally Time to Hit the Breaks on Carvana Stock,TSLA,Yahoo,"The rally in Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) truly has been incredible. After plunging during the market's panic in March, CVNA stock has gained 450% from its lows, and trades at an all-time high.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com On its face, the rally seems like far too much. Carvana is unprofitable. The coronavirus pandemic disrupted its business, as it did so many others. Effects may linger for the rest of the year, if not longer.And yet CVNA stock is now up 34% so far in 2020. It has a market capitalization over $20 billion. Incredibly, Carvana is now more valuable than CarMax (NYSE:KMX), whose revenue is almost five times as large.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsI don't think that knee-jerk reaction is quite right. Investors can't make the same mistake now that the market did in March: focusing on short-term disruption while ignoring long-term potential. Carvana has real long-term potential.Still, I'm sympathetic to valuation concerns after this rally. Carvana's business model is intriguing, but unproven. A new rival just went public. And I wonder if investor attention will move elsewhere in the next few months. CVNA stock has a path to upside over the long haul, but it seems like the easy money has been made. The Case for CVNA StockThe case for CVNA stock at its core is simple: the company has the potential to revolutionize the used-car industry. And that industry is massive.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge Used-car sales in the U.S. totaled $841 billion in 2019. Carvana's trailing twelve-month revenue of $4.3 billion suggests it has roughly one-half of one percent of the market. Obviously, there's a long runway for growth just in the U.S. Presumably, Carvana at some point could move into overseas markets as well.In this market, an opportunity like that has been enough for upside, particularly when paired with solid execution. And Carvana has executed impressively. Revenue doubled in 2019, after rising 128% the year before.It's true that Carvana isn't profitable. But it shouldn't be. Again, there's a huge opportunity to take market share.At the end of 2019, according to the company's Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Carvana locations serviced about two-thirds of the U.S. population. There's room for greater footprint expansion, while many potential customers likely aren't yet aware of the brand, or its online shopping options.Valuation is not a reason to ignore a stock like this. Carvana is a disruptor. And disruptors, whether Carvana or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM), are not going to be cheap.So I wouldn't steer investors toward selling CVNA stock solely because it's expensive. I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone try and short the name, even though half the float is sold short at the moment. Does the Business Work?As attractive as the business is, however, there are some concerns with the stock.Most notably, Carvana hasn't proven itself yet. The reason that half the float is sold short isn't just because Carvana's stock is expensive. Most short sellers are wise enough not to short on valuation alone. (Many of those who weren't have been chased out of the market.)Rather, bears believe the business model doesn't work. They would argue that there are reasons why CarMax, the largest used-car dealer in the country, only has market share of less than 3%. The industry is fragmented not because no one has thought to consolidate it, but because small, local dealers have an edge in some ways over large, faceless corporations.I don't believe that's necessarily the case. But Carvana still has to prove otherwise. It's most likely that the company is unprofitable because it's investing in growth. It's at least possible, as bears would claim, that its structural costs are simply too high.Bears don't have to be proven right immediately. After a 450% rally, any sign of weakness, of basically any kind, can tank CVNA stock.The name obviously has taken its place as a pandemic play. That, plus the rally leaves no room for error over the rest of the year. Will Investors Look Elsewhere?Meanwhile, there's a new kid on the proverbial block. Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM) went public this week and roared out of the gate.At the very least, that does create competition for growth investor dollars that might have gone to CVNA stock. (To be fair, Vroom's initial public offering has done nothing yet to dent the optimism toward Carvana.)More broadly, Vroom's IPO is one more near- to mid-term risk to a stock that, again, has more than quintupled in barely three months. Those risks seem to be piling up.CVNA needs broader optimism to hold. It needs earnings in the second half of the year to be almost perfectly on point. And it needs the pandemic to stay front and center in investors' minds enough that they don't pivot to more challenged sectors like travel and restaurants.It seems like a lot to ask in the short term. And so even investors bullish on the long term should consider the possibility that the market provides a more attractive entry point in the not-too-distant future.Matthew McCall left Wall Street to actually help investors -- by getting them into the world's biggest, most revolutionary trends BEFORE anyone else.

2020-06-19 13:53:37,Tequila Heiress Gets $19 Million Loan for Billionaires’ Row Home,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Karen Virginia Beckmann is making the most of owning a home at one of New York’s top addresses.A U.S. company controlled by the Mexican heiress -- part of the billionaire family behind Jose Cuervo tequila -- got an $18.8 million, 30-year loan last month from Citigroup Inc. for a luxury condo at 432 Park Ave., filings show. A limited liability corporation she controls acquired the home in the 96-story tower three years ago for about $45 million, without a mortgage.The transaction offers a glimpse at how the rich leverage assets for liquidity. Among the mega-wealthy, Elon Musk has used his shares in Tesla Inc. to obtain personal loans, while Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison has put up millions of the company’s shares to fund a lifestyle that includes trophy properties, America’s Cup teams and the Indian Wells tennis facility in California.“You wouldn’t go and raise that amount of money to sit on the cash,” Paul Welch, founder of largemortgageloans.com, said of Beckmann’s loan. “You raise it to buy, and trade in, other assets.”A representative for Beckmann declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for Citigroup.The financing came about a month after Beckmann, 51, gained control of the holding company for Park Avenue Residence -- the LLC that owns the condo -- from her father, Becle SAB Chairman Juan Francisco Beckmann, according to a regulatory filing. The 80-year-old patriarch also transferred a chunk of his stake in the Mexico City-based spirits company to his daughter last year, making her one of the world’s richest women.A Becle spokesperson declined to comment.The Park Avenue building -- one of the tallest residential towers in the Western Hemisphere -- is among the luxury developments in Midtown Manhattan that make up Billionaires’ Row, where more homes exceeding $25 million were sold in the last five years than on any other road globally. Saudi retail magnate Fawaz Al Hokair bought the penthouse for a reported $87.7 million.Residents at 432 Park Ave. have access to a private restaurant, 75-foot indoor swimming pool and yoga studio, private screening room and storage for their wine collections, according to the building’s website.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

""Bottom line: Tesla's lead in batteries is sustainable and other auto OEMs will struggle to gain measurable ground on the company's 80% US EV market share.""Why Does Tesla Lead? Tesla's edge over auto peers comes from its (expensive) interest in vertical integration.""The most significant advantage is that product design cycle times decrease, which quickens the pace of innovation, which is Tesla's central competitive moat,"" Munster wrote. ""Additionally, the end product typically yields better performance and reliability compared to products built with horizontal integration.""So far, the strategy has resulted in superior vehicle range. As Loup sees it, Tesla could maintain its superiority through in-house cell design and production. The company recently acquired Maxwell Technologies to design its own battery with proprietary chemistry.""Separately, based on the company's 2019 acquisition of Hibar Systems, we expect Tesla will begin manufacturing its own batteries in the next three to five years,"" Munster wrote, noting that vehicle demand will require collaboration with extant suppliers.Loup Ventures expects Tesla to announce an Austin Gigafactory focused on battery cell production.Price Action: At the time of publication, Tesla's stock was trading around $1,005 per share.Related Links:Can Tesla's Stock Maintain The Magic ,000 Level?Tesla Analyst Says Plunging Registrations In Key California Market Pushing Street Delivery Estimates DownLatest Ratings for TSLA  DateFirmActionFromTo  Jun 2020Goldman SachsDowngradesBuyNeutral  Jun 2020Morgan StanleyDowngradesEqual-WeightUnderweight  Jun 2020WedbushMaintainsNeutral    View More Analyst Ratings for TSLA   View the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from Benzinga  * Your Favorite Companies, As Defined By Urban Dictionary  * 5 Reasons Why Morgan Stanley And Goldman Sachs Downgraded Tesla  * Tesla Analyst Values SpaceX At B, With Starlink The Biggest Growth Driver(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-19 17:29:18,Analysts Can No Longer Justify the Valuation of Tesla Stock,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock has gotten a series of major downgrades in recent weeks. Two downgrades last Friday should be particularly worrisome for the owners of Tesla stock.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com I suppose the first major Tesla downgrade came back on May 1 from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. That was the day Musk tweeted, ""Tesla stock price is too high imo."" I don't know if that tweet represents a downgrade to a ""hold"" rating or a ""sell"" rating. Regardless, TSLA stock was trading at $701 at the time, and now it's trading at $998.But in this story I will focus on the downgrades from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs because they came from professional Wall Street analysts.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Problem With TSLA StockI'll start off with Tesla's valuation problem, which is the core of Goldman's thesis. Tesla is now trading at seven times its sales and 312 times its forward earnings.Tesla bulls argue that its shares should be valued as a high-growth tech stock and not as an auto stock. But at this point, Tesla is more overvalued than even the poster child of tech growth stocks, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Tesla's forward earnings multiple is roughly three times higher than Amazon's, and its price-sales ratio is more than 50% higher than Amazon's.For those people crazy enough to still see a company that makes cars as an auto company, the valuations are even more absurd. Tesla's forward earnings multiple is 4,800% higher than that of Ford (NYSE:F) stock.Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney seems like a genuine Tesla bull. But at some point, even the most bullish analyst has to be pragmatic and logical.""We'd look to become more positive on Tesla stock again if we had more confidence in the near to intermediate term trajectory in fundamentals, or if valuation became more attractive,"" Delaney says.  * 10 Robotics Stocks on the Technological Cutting Edge It seems like he would be itching to recommend the stock if only its valuation wasn't laughable. Goldman now has a ""hold"" rating and a $950 price target on Tesla. The Risk Facing TeslaMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas chose to focus more on the potential risks to Tesla's business and its growth outlook. Jonas said Tesla stock is pricing in too much near-term success, since the world is in the middle of a pandemic.Auto sales and particularly auto prices will likely take a big hit in 2020. At the same time, auto demand is softening, and Tesla is facing a wave of international competition in China and Europe. Finally, Tesla is facing increasing competition on the autonomous vehicle front from companies with far more resources.Jonas specifically mentioned Amazon as a potential autonomous-vehicle (AV)  competitor. However, Navigant Research recently named Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Waymo as the clear market leader in AV technology.Finally, Jonas said China is one of the brightest growth opportunities for Tesla. But Tesla could also take a much bigger hit than other U.S. stocks if relations between the US and China break down ahead of the November election.""Among the many risks facing Tesla at this time, we would rank risks related to US-China relations at the very top,"" Jonas says.Morgan Stanley dropped its rating on TSLA stock to ""underperform"" and cut its price target from $680 to $650. Tesla Is a BattlegroundI wrote back in November that Tesla gets so much love and so much hate because few people are actually treating it like an investment. Somehow Tesla has become a philosophical, political and generational battleground.When Tesla bulls buy a share of its stock, they see the move as a shot fired for the future and a win for social progress and the environment. When Tesla bears short a share of stock, they see the move as a vote for reality, reason and centuries of proven investing principles.As I have said repeatedly, this situation is unique in today's market. Tesla is the most chaotic stock out there today. I don't want to touch it with a 10-foot pole, and neither does Wall Street.Following last week's downgrades, only 27.2% of the analysts who cover the stock have ""buy"" or ""outperform"" ratings on it. Given Wall Street's documented historical bias toward bullishness, that 27% number is startling.If you are going long or short Tesla at this point, good luck to you. You're going to need it.

2020-06-22 12:36:16,Elon Musk: Tesla’s 7-Seat Model Y Production Now Set For ‘Early Q4’,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has revealed that the production of a 7-seat version of the Model Y will take place before the end of the year.In a Twitter post, Musk stated that production will begin ‘probably early Q4.’ According to Electrek, this would place the first deliveries around October or November of 2020. The publication also writes that the limited leg-room displayed by prototype models could ultimately see the 7-seat version having a rear-facing third row instead of front-facing.Tesla shares have exploded by 139% so far year-to-date. As a result, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently downgraded the stock to Hold with a $950 price target. “We’d look to become more positive on Tesla stock again if we had more confidence in the near to intermediate term trajectory of fundamentals, or if valuation became more attractive,” Delaney told investors.However Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois has just boosted his TSLA price target to a Street-high $1,200 from $650, explaining: “Tesla is still the only legacy-free OEM engaged in a positive EV sum game. Against expectations even a few months back, the gap with peers is widening, from product to battery tech/capacity.”The analyst concluded: “We fear volatility may remain high but raise our DCF-based PT to $1,250 on higher mid-term growth (+2pp) and lower cost of capital (-1pp to 8%)”. His new price target indicates further upside potential of 20%.Overall, TSLA has a Hold analyst consensus with 11 Sell ratings and 9 Hold ratings versus 8 Buy ratings. Meanwhile, the Street’s $679 average price target implies 32% downside potential in the shares over the coming year.

Ives said Austin, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma appear to be frontrunners at this point.Ives said another big question for investors will be determining whether or not the Cybertruck will be a niche ""wow factor"" model or a serious, large-scale challenger for legacy truck makers.Finally, Ives said Tesla investors will be watching the development of early-stage EV truck competitor Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA), which is targeting 2022 for the launch of its Badger EV pickup truck.Looking ahead, Ives said expectations for the Cybertruck will likely be between 175,000 and 200,000 deliveries in the first full year of production.Benzinga's Take: Ives' Cybertruck delivery projection of at least 175,000 trucks in 2022 is fairly aggressive given Tesla delivered just 367,500 vehicles total in 2019.Ives' $1,000 price target and Neutral rating are also indicative of how even bullish Tesla analysts are having a difficult time justifying much valuation upside from current levels.Do you agree with this take?

2020-06-22 22:13:39,Tesla: Weak California Registrations Keep This Top Analyst Sidelined,TSLA,Yahoo,"If the coronavirus is a wound which Tesla (TSLA) has so far managed to cover up, then, according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, “the band-aid just got ripped off.”Confirming the Street’s concerns, the release of April and May registration figures for Model 3s in California – Tesla’s “core sweet spot,” – indicated a year-over-year drop of 37%.“Domestically speaking California remains a linchpin to Model 3 success for Tesla and now all eyes shift to the trajectory in the month of June and especially into the core summer months heading into Fall in hopes of a rebound as Fremont enters 2H,” the 5-star analyst said.However, California is not the only state reporting weak numbers. In 24 other states, registrations dropped by 33% in the same period.The Street was already bracing for a COVID shaped decline when it recently brought down expectations for Tesla deliveries this year, reducing the figure to 400,000 units instead of the previously expected 550,000.Tesla shares have soared recently, clocking an all-time high of $1025.05 on June 10. Instigating the recent rally were the glowing figures reported from its Shanghai Giga 3 factory. The pace of Model 3s zooming out the doors had beaten expectations, hinting at a “staggering China growth rebound.”Ives believes that China and the upcoming Battery Day, in which Tesla is expected to reveal game changing battery technology, remain key catalysts in the near-term. However, to maintain momentum, Tesla needs to make sure its disappointing performance on home soil won’t become a regular theme.“The bulls will shrug off these negative California registrations although must see signs of a rebound over the coming months with the lockdown easing and the ‘Fremont Stand-Off’ in the rear-view mirror,” Ives warned.To this end, Ives keeps a Neutral (i.e. Hold) rating on Tesla, along with a $1,000 price target. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)Ives’ rating is backed by the rest of the Street. Based on 8 Buys, 9 Holds and 11 Sells, Tesla scores a Hold consensus rating. However, here is where Ives and the consensus part ways. The average price target is well below the Wedbush analyst’s, and at $678.82, indicates possible downside of a sharp 32%.

2020-06-23 04:46:39,Trump Orders Freeze on Many Work Visas Through End of Year,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump signed an order Monday temporarily halting access to several employment-based visas, affecting hundreds of thousands of people seeking to work in the U.S. The technology industry said the move would hurt the economy.The order freezes new H1-B and H-4 visas, used by technology workers and their families, as well as L visas for intra-company transfers and most J visas for work- and study-abroad programs, including au pairs, through the end of the year.The issuance of new green cards will also remain halted through the end of the year.The new action will pause some H2-B visas for seasonal workers, with an exception for those in the food-processing industry, according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters Monday.Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. called the order “short-sighted,” saying immigrant tech labor could help the U.S. economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said on Twitter he was “disappointed” and that “we’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.” Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a tweet the order goes too far.India’s NASSCOM, the trade body representing IT service giants like Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., called the Trump administration’s decision “misguided and harmful to the US economy.” Noting the benefits that overseas workers bring, it said in a statement that “Without their continued contributions to the U.S. economy, the economic pain would worsen, industry would slow, and the timeline for a treatment and cure of Covid-19 would lengthen.”Trump acted with the U.S. facing an unemployment rate of 13.3% after businesses closed or reduced staff in response to the virus outbreak. The president’s order won’t affect immigrant workers who already hold the visas.“Under the extraordinary circumstances of the economic contraction resulting from the Covid-19 outbreak, certain nonimmigrant visa programs authorizing such employment pose an unusual threat to the employment of American workers,” Trump said in his order.Speaking Saturday in an interview with Fox News, Trump said he wants Americans to take jobs that would otherwise go to people granted the visas.“We have plenty of people looking for jobs,” he told Fox. “I think it’s going to make a lot of people very happy. And it’s common sense.”Trump tweeted at the height of the coronavirus pandemic that he planned to “temporarily suspend immigration into the U.S.” Industry groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Information Technology Industry Council, wrote to Trump to express concern that restrictions would disrupt business and hamper growth.The U.S. issued more than 900,000 visas in fiscal year 2019 in the categories Trump plans to freeze.H-1B CriticismIn the past few years, the administration has moved to tighten the H-1B program, and the approval rate for applications has fallen. The technology industry relies on H-1B visas to hire overseas talent, particularly in the fields of science and engineering. Critics say some companies have abused the program to displace American workers.About three-quarters of H-1B visas go to people working in the technology industry, though the exact levels vary year by year. The number of non-immigrant visas issued in 2019 declined for the fourth consecutive year, to 8.7 million from 10.9 million in 2015, according to the State Department.CompTIA, a trade group that represents big tech companies like Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet Inc. said the move would deal a lasting blow to the economy.“Making it more difficult for bright minds to work in the U.S. only benefits our competitors abroad who will attract their talents to build and develop cutting-edge, job-creating goods and services,” said Cinnamon Rogers, CompTIA’s executive vice president for public advocacy.TechNet, a lobbying group that represents most of the largest tech companies, had been pushing for the Trump administration to show leniency to the hundreds of thousands of H-1B holders already in the U.S. who lost their jobs in the Covid-19 pandemic and now risk falling into illegal status.Nandini Nair, an immigration partner at Greenspoon Marder, said the new order would have an “enormous effect” on U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector. Many spent thousands of dollars filing paperwork for each H-1B visa applicant, she said.“They expended all of this money and planned their budgets and workforce capabilities on these visas and that’s now shot,” Nair said.The order not only limits the ability of companies to recruit talent from overseas, but also impacts their current foreign workers who have been waiting to get their visas authorized. When an H-1B visa is awarded to individuals, they must travel to a consulate outside the U.S., typically in their home country, to activate it.Many workers have been unable to travel since the coronavirus pandemic shut borders across the world. “A lot of these workers are now prisoners in the U.S. because they don’t have a valid visa stamp in their passport -- if they go, they can’t come back in,” Nair said.However, Fragomen Worldwide immigration lawyer James Pack, who provides counsel to businesses in the tech sector, said the executive order would only have a limited impact on U.S. companies because it only applies to first-time H-1B applicants who are outside the country. Those already working for firms inside the U.S. would not be impacted, Pack said.The current cap for those visas is 85,000 annually. H-4 visas are issued to immediate family members of H-1B visa holders.The H1-B program will be restructured to put an emphasis on would-be immigrants with the highest salary offers once the program restarts next year, the senior administration official said. Under such changes, entry-level workers coming from colleges are less likely to get the visa, as the spots will mostly go to people who have master’s degrees or doctorates working in high-earning fields such as trading, algorithms, and IT, said Shannon Donnelly, a partner and immigration attorney at Morgan Lewis.(Updates with comment from India’s NASSCOM in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-06-23 09:00:16,Electric Car Charging Stations Are Finally About to Take Off,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The electric vehicle sector has been stuck for years with a chicken-and-egg problem. Until there were extensive networks of public charging stations, a critical mass of people would never feel comfortable driving EVs—but until a critical mass of people were driving EVs, there was no sense in investing in extensive networks of public charging stations.It may be the coronavirus pandemic that finally breaks the stalemate. BloombergNEF’s latest Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook predicts that EVs sales will experience a smaller dip than traditional auto sales as a result of the broader economic squeeze, and that they’ll bounce back more quickly once the market recovers. EVs and the infrastructure needed to charge them have also been a part of many of the stimulus packages announced by European and Asian governments. Just in the past few weeks, Germany included chargers in its €2.5 billion proposed economic package, and the European Union announced that it’s aiming to have 1 million public chargers by 2025, from fewer than 200,000 today.“There's absolutely a case for vehicle charging infrastructure to be part of the recovery,” says Matt Allen, chief executive officer at Pivot Power, a U.K. battery and charging developer. Fast chargers demand large amounts of power in one location and the installation is difficult and expensive, he says. Government investment could help companies clear that hurdle, create much-needed jobs, and give the economy a further boost as the EV sector expands.“It will make smaller, more niche projects more investable because more EVs driving around mean a bigger customer base,” Allen says, adding: “We want stimulus, not a long-term crutch for the industry.”The key is to get drivers past the so-called anxiety range, or the fear of running out of battery life and winding up stranded on the road. Until recently, however, that wasn’t a challenge anyone particularly wanted to take on, says Javier Guerra, a managing partner at private equity firm Satif Group and an early investor in California plug-in venture ChargePoint. Carmakers had no incentive to build chargers other brands could profit from (Tesla Inc.’s chargers, for instance, only fit its own cars and are mainly designed for home use), while utilities, oil companies, and institutional investors considered the sector to be too young, too risky, or both.“When I started to look at [EV charging] back in 2016, very few people saw the point, and there was little money to be made,” Guerra says. Since then, the cost of EV batteries has declined by 43%, according to BNEF, making EVs much more accessible for the average car-buyer. That, together with stricter emissions regulations in Europe and China, has convinced large investors that EVs are poised for a breakthrough.Oil companies and utilities especially are well positioned to dominate the EV charging market. Oil suppliers already operate strategically located fueling stations for internal combustion vehicles, and utilities control electricity production and distribution networks.“I don’t think there are clear winners yet,” says Aleksandra O’Donovan, head of electric vehicles at BloombergNEF. “Oil majors invest in EV charging either because they can or must as it is mandated, and they can afford to hedge on the future.”Based on its estimates for EV adoption over the next 20 years, BNEF projects that 12 million public EV charging points will be needed globally by 2040, up from fewer than 1 million today. That will require a worldwide investment of about $111 billion.Oil majors and utilities have rushed into the sector, starting with Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which bought charging network NewMotion in 2017; the company now owns or operates 142,000 chargers across Europe, and entered the U.S. market last year with the purchase of infrastructure and software provider Greenlots. Rival BP Plc, meanwhile, acquired Chargemaster and its 7,000 stations for $170 million in 2018.Utilities see the electrification of transport as a potential savior. Global electricity consumption is expected to slow as industries and appliances become more energy efficient, but EVs could help prop up residential demand.“As an electric vehicle user you don’t need to go to a petrol station anymore—you leave your house fully charged. It’s a completely different concept,” says Luis Buil, global head of smart mobility at Spain’s Iberdrola SA. “We’re already in the grid and we can guarantee that the power you charge your car with is 100% renewable.”Iberdrola announced in March that it would accelerate plans to spend 150 million euros ($170 million) on its own fast charging network. And French utility EDF, which already owned over 100,000 charging points across Europe through its subsidiary Izivia, acquired a majority stake in Pod Point in February, which has more than 69,000 charge points in the U.K. and Norway.The holy grail charger for automakers, oil companies, and utilities doesn’t require a grid connection at all. Shell and Tesla, among others, are working towards building a mini-power station with solar panels that can generate and store enough energy to provide a consistent source of charge. If, or when, available commercially, it would make electric vehicles and charging infrastructure fully green.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-06-23 10:00:15,Robinhood Crowd Misses Out on Convertible Bonds,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s growing more likely by the day that we’ve reached peak “bored retail trader” in the financial markets.Bloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal and seemingly every financial news publication has now profiled Dave Portnoy, founder of the website Barstool Sports, who has turned to day-trading stocks with sports on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic. Robinhood Financial’s trading app is all the rage, being credited with the shocking rally in shares of bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc. that almost prompted an unthinkable offering of potentially worthless stock. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Matt Levine has called this entire phenomenon the “boredom markets hypothesis.” If this trend is close to running its course, more traditional investors might want to consider what happens when the music stops and Portnoy’s No. 1 rule — “stocks only go up” — doesn’t work so flawlessly. The S&P; 500 Index’s sharp rally from its March lows is already starting to fizzle, with the index down more than 3% during the past two weeks. While hardly backbreaking, it’s the largest loss over such a sustained period since the worst of the selloff three months ago. Even sideways trading for the summer would violate the day trader’s mantra.Fortunately for sophisticated investors who might side with Warren Buffett and Leon Cooperman over the Robinhood crowd, there’s an intriguing asset class for this crossroads: convertible bonds.The securities, which can be swapped for shares at specified prices, have already been having something of a moment. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Convertibles Composite Total Return index jumped to a record on June 8 and remains close to that lofty level. Convertible bonds have gained 7.8% so far in 2020, better than the 5% return on investment-grade corporate bonds and the roughly 3% loss for the S&P; 500. I’ve written before about how it seems as if there’s something inherently “cheap” about convertibles that boosts returns above and beyond a mix of stocks and bonds. Part of it might be the types of companies that offer such securities. Within the Bloomberg Barclays index, some of the biggest names include Tesla Inc., Carnival Corp., Southwest Airlines Co., Microchip Technology Inc. and Workday Inc. In other words, a combination of technology companies that have powered the U.S. stock market rally and brand-name businesses particularly harmed by the coronavirus but part of the “recovery trade” strategy. American Airlines Group Inc. is in the market selling convertible notes, too.Some of these individual companies are favorites of the new day-trading crowd. But for those who want to bet on convertible bonds, and specifically to keep trading relatively small sums with zero commission, the $4 trillion exchange-traded fund market is probably their best bet. Yet even the asset class’s sharp rally hasn’t been enough to lure individuals from the thrill of wagering on the trendy stock pick of the day. Consider the $717 million iShares Convertible Bond exchange-traded fund (ticker ICVT), which has soared since March and is up more than 6% this month alone. A few weeks ago, it looked as if it might have been discovered — on June 3, its assets increased by 21% as investors poured a net $108.3 million into the fund, the most since its inception roughly five years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained an additional $69 million on June 9, good for the second-biggest inflow ever. On the flip side, State Street’s $4.47 billion SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities ETF (ticker CWB) suffered an outflow of $107.6 million on June 10, the largest daily withdrawal on record, followed by a $75 million exodus on June 11. That’s a stark contrast to the tens of billions of dollars flowing into credit ETFs.That seeming lack of interest is just fine for investors like Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer and head of alternative strategies at Calamos Advisors. The Naperville, Illinois-based firm is the largest public holder of convertible bonds issued in April by Carnival and Southwest Airlines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“It’s a great way to play the stock market in a less volatile way,” he said in a phone interview. While this is the common elevator pitch for investing in convertibles, the securities backed up that claim during March’s turbulence by tumbling less than benchmark equity indexes. That’s because investors can always fall back on interest payments if equity prices fall while capitalizing on a rally because the value of the option to convert to shares increases as well.Pars says convertibles are compelling for those with significant equity holdings who want to dial back their risk a bit after the sharp rebound in the past three months, or for those who sat out the entire rally and want some protection from a reversal. It’s a safer bet than simply taking short positions on the S&P; 500; Bloomberg News’s Cameron Crise calculated that speculators have ratcheted up their bets against the index to the most extreme level since 2011.In some ways, the new band of Robinhood traders plays right into the hands of investors like Pars. He manages the $9 billion Calamos Market Neutral Income Fund, which partly employs a strategy known as convertible arbitrage. The trade involves buying and holding the convertible bond while hedging with a short position in the common stock, in theory generating a nearly riskless profit from price discrepancies between the two assets. That’s more likely to happen when there’s added volatility — and especially when the fluctuations seemingly come out of nowhere. “It’s one thing when you have volatility driven by real fundamentals,” Pars says. “When you have more noise volatility, that’s perfect for an arb.”With so much uncertainty surrounding how quickly states can emerge from lockdowns, and just how quickly Americans will travel the way they used to, even modest downside protection, like the 1.25% interest rate on Southwest Airlines’s convertible securities, can be a comfort for investors. That could wind up being a better yield than similar maturity Treasuries over the next five years, given that it’s anyone’s guess whether the Federal Reserve will have raised short-term interest rates from near-zero by then.These are the prudent — albeit less entertaining — calculations that professional investors are paid to think about. There’s still a large divide between the newbie traders who fly in and out of stock and ETF positions on a whim thanks to no-fee trading, and Wall Street denizens who scrutinize market segments mostly out of reach of Robinhood. The former are best thought of like shares of Hertz, surging 682% in the span of days but now sputtering toward zero again.Convertible bonds, by contrast, have delivered average annual returns of 9% or higher over three-, five-, 10- and 15-year horizons. It stands to reason they’ll keep doing so long after the legions of bored traders find a new hobby.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

2020-06-23 15:18:30,"Tesla&#39;s Electric Vehicle Competition &#39;Not A Measurable Threat&#39; Yet, Gene Munster Says",TSLA,Yahoo,"Thanks to its control of 80% of the U.S. electric vehicle market, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has the highest valuation in the auto industry.Rivals are never far off in the rearview mirror, a Tesla expert said this week. ""For the company's valuation to advance higher it will need to hold off other automakers as they roll out new EVs over the next five years,"" Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster said in a Monday note.Munster's Latest Tesla Projections: Munster said he expects Tesla's domestic share to fall below 25% over the next decade, adding that it will fend off competition in the near-term.""Based on the currently available EV models in the U.S. market, along with the models expected to be released next year, we believe Tesla will exit 2021 with a 70-80% market share,"" he wrote. ""If we're correct, Tesla's economies of scale will strengthen, making it more difficult for traditional automakers to benefit from the long-term secular shift to electric.""So far, competitors have failed to introduce a serious threat. Automaker timelines suggest the U.S. EV market could have between 16 and 28 vehicles by the end of 2020 -- but few hold a candle to Tesla's Model 3.""The majority of these new models suffer from one of two critical flaws: starting prices above $70,000 and/or ranges below 225 miles,"" Munster wrote. ""These two flaws rule out most EVs as mainstream options.""Only five vehicles currently qualify as ""mainstream,"" and, in Munster's view, Tesla's Model 3 leads the pack with superior software, charging networks and design.Munster's Tesla Takeaway: ""Bottom line: competition in 2020 (and likely in 2021) is not a measurable threat to Tesla,"" Munster wrote.""The Model 3 is still unchallenged in its EV value proposition and we expect the availability this year of the short-range, $40k Model Y to help further sustain Tesla's market position.""TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were up 1.42% at $1,008.45 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2020-06-23 19:19:08,Tesla Analyst Gordon Johnson: &#39;I Couldn&#39;t Be More Bearish&#39;,TSLA,Yahoo,"GLJ Research founder Gordon Johnson joined Benzinga's PreMarket Prep show Tuesday. Among the topics Johnson discussed: electric vehicle leader Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the recent EV truck IPO Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA).Tesla's Q2: Johnson said Tesla investors should be bracing for brutal second-quarter numbers given the state of the global auto market.""Tesla's accounting is always tricky. They recognize a lot of things and they pull a lot of things forward. But if you just look at the registration data, in Colorado, which is the most generous EV market, their sales in April-May are down 73%, he told PreMarket Prep. Johnson said recent numbers in the rest of the U.S., Europe and China also paint a bearish picture for Tesla's quarter.Johnson's Tesla Bear Thesis: Tesla shares have been on an incredible run in the last year, but Johnson remains bearish on the stock.""I couldn't be more bearish. Look, Tesla is completely detached from reality. The stock has kicked my butt. I'll admit that, and people laugh when I say I'm bearish,"" he said Tuesday. Tesla's valuation is more than double that of VOLKSWAGEN AG/ADR (OTCMKTS: VWAGY), which sold 10 million vehicles in 2019, the analyst said. Tesla sold 365,000 vehicles last year.""They've never made a profit. We think they're going to lose money again this year,"" Johnson said.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been repeatedly shifting the goalpost when it comes to Tesla's success story, he said. Johnson On Tesla's Lineup: ""Initially it was the S and the X that were going to dominate in the luxury market. That didn't happen. Then it was going to be the Model 3, which was their mass-market car, which took them to profitability. That didn't happen. Then it was the Model Y, right? They won't even tell you what orders are on the Model Y.""He noted that Tesla has now shifted attention to its Cybertruck preorders.""Listen, the deposit for the Cybertruck is $50. I don't think the truck is street legal. They don't have a facility to make it. It's almost like the Tesla Semi, where they were taking preorders for $100,000 three years ago and they still haven't made the car.""Analysts and investors seem to be making an erroneous connection between the momentum of Tesla's stock and its underlying business, Johnson said. ""As we get through this year I think people are going to realize that Tesla's not only losing share, but momentum for EVs is slowing."" Johnson On Nikola: Shares of Tesla competitor Nikola have skyrocketed 573% in the last three months. While Johnson doesn't officially cover Nikola stock, he said he's skeptical of the hype surrounding the company.""Hydrogen trucks make sense. The problem is [Nikola CEO Trevor Milton] doesn't have a plant to produce it, he doesn't have a working truck and the stock is valued as if he's going to take over the entire trucks space."" Johnson has a year-end price target of $87 for Tesla. The stock was trading 0.68% higher at $1,001.08 at the time of publication Tuesday.

Wouldn't bring this up if not very important,"" Musk reportedly said in the email.Tesla's Quarter:  Tesla has contended with both supply and demand side disruptions in the quarter.

2020-06-24 16:02:56,Detroit automakers take big steps in annual quality survey,TSLA,https://www.newstimes.com,"DETROIT (AP) - Detroit-area automakers made their strongest showing ever in an annual survey of vehicle quality, as once-dominant Japanese brands faded. 
 The annual survey by J.D. Power also found that luxury brands performed below the industry average, often because they come equipped with more glitchy new electronics than mainstream brands. 
 Most Detroit-area brands outpaced the industry average in problems per 100 vehicles, with Fiat Chrysler's Dodge brand tying for first place with Kia of South Korea. Five of the top 10 brands were from Detroit, with Chevrolet third, followed by Ram, Genesis, Mitsubishi, Buick, GMC, Volkswagen and Hyundai. Dodge and Kia tied at 136 problems per 100 vehicles. 
 Land Rover ranked last with owners reporting 228 problems per 100 vehicles, followed by Audi, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar. Toyota, which traditionally ranks in the top 10, dropped below the industry average to 21st out of 32 brands included in the survey with 177 problems per 100 vehicles. 
 Detroit automakers benefited from a change in the study's methodology, which was updated this year to include more questions about new technology, said Doug Betts, president of J.D. Power's Automotive Division and a former quality chief for Fiat Chrysler. 
 The survey is redone every five years, and questions were added about features that didn't exist during the last update, he said. As a result, owners reported more problems within the first 90 days of owning 2020 models, raising the industry average from a record low 93 problems per 100 vehicles last year to 166 problems this year. 
 That doesn't mean quality is getting worse; it just means that more questions were asked about newer features, Betts said. Some questions, such as those about exterior rust or outside lights failing, were dropped from the survey because they..."

When a customer purchases FSD, only half of the money is recognized as revenue, while the rest is deferred as new FSD features are rolled out.Once all features have been released to customers, Tesla can recognize 100% of revenue from FSD sales.

Exxon, which dropped to $185 billion, is reeling from the worst crude-price crash in history. The largest oil company in the Western Hemisphere is preparing to cut some of its U.S. workforce.Tesla also is on the verge of passing Toyota Motor Corp. to become the most valuable automaker in the world by market capitalization. The company topped Boeing Co. in March to become the most valuable industrial company in the U.S. and reached the No. 2 spot among car manufacturers in January by passing Volkswagen AG.Exxon is the world’s second-biggest energy company after Saudi Aramco went public late last year. But even the status of Saudi Aramco as the world’s most-valuable company is in danger now after Apple Inc. reduced the valuation gap to $150 billion, down from about $750 billion at the time of the initial public offering of the Saudi state-controlled oil giant six months ago.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-06-30 17:20:28,Tesla Analyst Says Nikola Badger Preorders Should Give Investors Clues To The Electric Pickup Market,TSLA,Yahoo,"Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA), the new kid on the electric vehicle block, has started accepting preorders for its Badger electric pickup truck,  which is seen as direct competition to Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Cybertruck.The Tesla Analyst:  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has a Neutral rating on Tesla with a $1,000 price targeTesla Vs. Nikola Preorders:  The Nikola Badger clearly goes after Tesla's Cybertruck, which has built a ""formidable"" list of customers since its  launch  late last year, Ives said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.)The Badger will be available in two versions:one powered by an EV battery with a 300-mile range and another powered by fuel cells with a 600-mile range, the analyst said. Pre-orders for Tesla's Cybertruck stand at a staggering 650,000, and momentum is continuing to build, he said.Tesla's pickup has an impressive steel framework and looks more out of a ""'Blade Runner' sci-fi movie,"" capitalizing on Musk and his team's penchant for thinking out of the box, Ives said. The analyst said he is of the view that pre-order activity for the Badger over the next three to six months will serve as a key data point for investors to get a sense of the market's potential adoption curve.Tesla Vs. Nikola EV Truck Positioning:  Ives also delved into how both companies would like to position their EV pickups in the market.""Investors will question if this is a mass market pickup for both Tesla and Nikola going after Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) with 3 million pickup trucks sold annually in the US, or a more niche ""wow factor"" model that will be more limited in demand/production scale and scope,"" the analyst said. For Tesla to hit Wedbush's $1,500 bull case, one key component will be future success with the pickup market, the Model Y and new vehicle versions and models, according to Wedbush.  TSLA Price Action:  Tesla shares were up 6.39% at $1,073.84 at the time of publication Tuesday, while Nikola shares were down 0.17% at $67.46.

It can carry a full load up inclines faster than its diesel competitors and has an impressive zero-to-60 mph time of 20 seconds when fully loaded.More information is expected to be revealed about the Tesla Semi and the batteries that power it during Tesla's combined shareholder meeting and battery day, which is scheduled for Sept. 15.

2020-06-30 19:08:18,It&#39;s Good To Be The King Of Tesla ETFs,TSLA,Yahoo,"Well, one of them anyway, but the benefits of having a large weight to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) are becoming more apparent with the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE: ARKK).What To Know: ARKK allocates 10.38% of its weight to shares of the high-flying electric vehicle maker, good for one of the largest allocations to Elon Musk's company among all exchange-traded funds. Data confirm investors like that allocation.""Traders put almost $180 million into the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) in the five-day period ended Friday, the most since it began trading in 2014,"" according to Bloomberg. ""That was the actively managed fund's 17th straight week of inflows.""Why It's Important: Tesla's 2020 ascent is palpable for ARKK in multiple ways.First and most importantly, the ARK fund is higher by 38.58%. Second, the aforementioned Bloomberg statistic doesn't even scratch the surface of investors' enthusiasm for ARKK this year. The fund has taken $1.66 billion in new assets since Jan. 1, boosting its assets under management tally to $4.57 billion while making it the largest equity-based actively managed ETF in the process.""Companies within ARKK include those that rely on or benefit from the development of new products or services, technological improvements and advancements in scientific research relating to the areas of DNA technologies ('Genomic Revolution'), industrial innovation in energy, automation and manufacturing ('Industrial Innovation'), the increased use of shared technology, infrastructure and services ('Next Generation Internet'), and technologies that make financial services more efficient ('Fintech Innovation'),"" according to ARK.In other words, ARKK is getting a lift from more than just Tesla. Invitae (NASDAQ: NVTA) and Square (NYSE: SQ), just name two, are helping the fund soar.What's Next: ""Tesla, which makes up almost 10% of ARKK, could continue to capitalize on the transition to electric vehicles and renewables that might be sped up by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" according to Bloomberg.With Tesla trading around $1,000, effectively freezing out plenty of retail investors, ARKK is a credible avenue for exposure to the stock.And if ARKK's Tesla weight isn't enough, investors can consider the ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (CBOE:ARKQ). That ARK fund, which is also actively managed, devotes almost 13% of its weight to Tesla.Investors put $92.39 million in ARKQ since the start of the year.See more from Benzinga  * 3 ETFs For Investors Looking To Access The Final Frontier  * 3 ETFs For Square Earnings(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-06-30 21:58:15,Will Tesla Match Q1 Deliveries? This Analyst Crunches the Numbers,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla (TSLA) shares have put together an impressive run in 2020, to say the least. The market has reacted favorably to reports of strong demand for Model 3s in China, a strong Q1 report and a penchant for tech growth stocks. As a result, shares have skyrocketed by a massive 158% since the turn of the year.Later this week, Tesla will announce 2Q20 delivery and production numbers and Wall Street will be keen to gauge the coronavirus’ impact on operations. Along with shuttered businesses around the world, Tesla’s sole US factory in Fremont, California, was shut down for much of the quarter.Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner expects Tesla to hit 76,000 deliveries in Q2, of which 60,000 are Model 3s, 8,000 Models S+X and 8,000 Model Ys. Consensus expects Tesla to deliver 67,000 vehicles.Breaking down Tesla’s main regions, the analyst estimates that in the US, Tesla will notch up 15,000 deliveries, down by 60% year-over-year, and an additional 10,000 in Europe (4,000 in the UK), and close to 30,000 in China, with South Korea and Canada making up the bulk of the rest.The estimates indicate a drop from the prior quarter. In Q1, Tesla reported delivery of 88,400 vehicles, in what amounted to its best ever performance.The weaker volumes are on Rosner’s mind when forecasting 2Q results. Rosner said, “We trim our 2Q revenue from $5.03bn to $4.97bn (also reflecting intra-quarter price cuts in the US) and lower auto GM from 13.9% to 13.5% (16.6% ex credit), leading to EPS of -$1.77 vs. prior -$1.66. This compares to consensus $4.8bn and -$1.61. For free cash flow, we expect a burn of about $500m mainly dragged down by A/P, largely unchanged from prior expectations.”All in all, Rosner keeps a Hold rating on Tesla, yet nudges the price target up from $850 to $900. Therefore, Rosner expects shares to drop by 17% over the coming months. (To watch Rosner’s track record, click here)Rosner's colleagues are reading from the same manual. Consensus rates Tesla a Hold, based on 7 buys, 9 Holds and 10 Sell ratings. However, sentiment on the Street is rather more bearish as the average price target comes in at $727.65, representing potential downside of 32% from current levels.

2020-07-01 02:41:53,Tesla’s China Plant Might Have Come to the Rescue Last Quarter,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. endured a roughly seven-week shutdown of its most important car plant in the world last quarter, but its brand-new backup factory may have saved the day.The manufacturer may have delivered more than 82,000 vehicles last quarter, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Some even expect Tesla to surpass the roughly 87,000 cars handed over to customers a year ago, or the more than 88,000 delivered in the first three months of this year.Expectations were much lower just a few months ago, when Tesla and its automotive peers shut factories and showrooms and watched their stock prices crater. But while other car manufacturers’ shares have come back slowly, Tesla’s have soared, closing Tuesday at a record high of $1,079.81. The company’s market capitalization has shot up to $200.3 billion, passing Exxon Mobil Corp. and closing in on auto industry leader Toyota Motor Corp.Shanghai and YWhat’s helping Tesla’s cause is its new plant near Shanghai, which just started delivering vehicles to public customers in January. The carmaker also began production of the Model Y crossover in March and rushed to reopen its Fremont, California, factory in May so that it could resume filling orders for what Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has predicted will become his top-seller.“The lesson learned by now is that TSLA shares tend to ‘work’ when something new has launched,” Jeffrey Osborne, a Cowen Inc. analyst with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock, said in a report Tuesday. “At this point both the Model Y and China built cars are ramping up.”Musk, 49, suggested to Tesla employees early this week that the company could manage to avoid a quarterly loss.“Breaking even is looking super tight,” the CEO wrote to staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. “Really makes a difference for every car you build and deliver. Please go all out to ensure victory!”Hibernating BearsMusk has sent many end-of-quarter internal memos both to rally employees and signal to investors, but his optimism has sometimes been misplaced. The then-record 97,000 deliveries Tesla reported for the three months that ended in September fell short of the 100,000 mark he floated in an email to workers.This quarter, though, even skeptics in the analyst community see reason to be upbeat.“With strong production in China and better-than-expected production in Fremont, we think that Tesla will beat what appears to be a low bar for deliveries,” Brian Johnson, a Barclays Plc analyst with a sell-equivalent rating on the stock, wrote in a report.He estimates 85,000 vehicle deliveries, potentially setting Tesla up for a quarterly profit that would make the stock eligible for inclusion in the S&P; 500 Index. Johnson still believes the carmaker’s shares are “fundamentally overvalued,” but believes they could keep moving higher in the coming weeks.“We urge our bearish friends (perhaps emboldened by a ~$1,000 stock price) to return to the shelter of their caves,” Johnson wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-01 13:53:17,Tesla Overtakes Toyota as the World’s Most Valuable Automaker,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. displaced Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s most valuable automaker, underscoring investor enthusiasm for a company trying to transform an industry that’s relied on internal combustion engines for more than 130 years.Shares of Tesla, which have more than doubled since the start of the year, climbed as much as 3.5% in intraday trading Wednesday, giving it a market capitalization of $207.2 billion, surpassing Toyota’s $201.9 billion.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has ignored or broken many of the established auto industry’s rules and norms in the 10 years since he took Tesla public, selling cars online and assembling vehicles in high-cost California. But while his company’s value has soared, there remains a gulf in the scale of his company and the world’s biggest car manufacturers.Tesla produced 103,000 vehicles in the first quarter, or about 4% of the almost 2.4 million made by Toyota, which built its brand on affordability and reliability backed by innovations in large-scale manufacturing.Tesla became the world’s second-most valuable automaker in January, when it surpassed Volkswagen AG. It’s now worth more than twice the German giant.After pioneering gas-electric vehicles with the Prius hybrid, Toyota was late to shift to fully electric autos and has wagered heavily on hydrogen fuel cells. The company is now making a series of high-profile investments in EVs and self-driving cars. The manufacturer has forecast an 80% plunge in profit this year and expects it could take until the first half of next year before the auto market recovers to pre-pandemic levels.Toyota’s market valuation includes the 14.3% of shares that Toyota itself holds as treasury stock, worth around $30 billion. Tesla doesn’t hold any treasury shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Over the past month, the stock increased by 26.15%, and in the past year, by 377.77%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently higher from its 52 week high by 2.41%.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P; 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.Most often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 12.32 in the Auto Manufacturers industry, Tesla Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 0.0. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.See more from Benzinga  * Afternoon Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For June 12, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Analyst Gregory Lewis at BTIG reiterated his buy rating on the electric van maker's stock but boosted his price target to $26, which is 77% above current levels, from $10. Lewis said a key takeaway from a call he hosted with management on Tuesday was that the company has ""first-mover"" advantage, which was solidified when the Series C van received final regulatory safety approvals, giving the company a 1-to-2-year head start on other electric vehicle (EV) last-mile delivery competitors. He said this should allow the company to secure a revolving credit facility, which would allow it to scale up operations. Lewis said a major potential catalyst could be a $6 billion to $8 billion contract from the U.S. Postal Service, in which bids are due later this month, and an announcement of the winner is expected later this year. He said another bullish factor is the optionality around the company's 10% equity stake in Lordstown Motors Corp., which unveiled its EV Endurance pickup truck last week.

2020-07-01 14:31:34,Tesla Raises Full Self-Driving Software Price To $8K As Features Mount,TSLA,Yahoo,"As promised by CEO Elon Musk, Tesla raised the price Wednesday of its FSD software to $8,000.Tesla's Self-Driving Pricing Adjustments: The move comes after a discount was made available over the last few weeks to certain customers who were missing features due to the timing of their purchase.Musk has said that the price of the software will continue increasing as it is further developed with more capabilities. The temporary discount for the Autopilot and Full Self Driving packages -- two seperate options on Tesla vehicles -- may have helped bring Tesla to breakeven this quarter, as Musk said the company was close to doing.These discounts may have been given in part to sway customers into clicking the purchase button on their app, quickly sending Tesla thousands of dollars with no employee-customer interaction needed. Owners are able to buy the software when ""building"" their vehicle on Tesla's website, or they can buy it post-purchase via the Tesla app. As Tesla rolls out more features for the FSD option, they are able to recognize more of the revenue on their balance sheet. In the second quarter, Tesla added the ability for vehicles to stop at intersections including stop signs, traffic lights, and ""T"" intersections.Later in July, Tesla added the ability to proceed through green lights without driver intervention. Whether these additions will allow Tesla to realize additional deferred revenue is unknown.Why It Matters: Tesla needs a profitable second quarter to qualify for entry into the S&P; 500. This could be a big moment for the company and add more fuel for the automaker's enormous run this year, which already totals more than 150% year-to-date. Benzinga's Take: Tesla has large revenue potential with the FSD software price increases. Tesla vehicles contain a lot of technology that gets cheaper over time. If Tesla can lower the price of the car by lowering the price of the battery -- the most expensive part -- it can get more cars to more people while also selling an ever-more-expensive software upgrade that becomes more enticing as new FSD features are released.And if Tesla can get to true Level 5 Full Self Driving, the sky is the limit with its  robotaxi plans.TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were up 4.21% to $1,125.22 at the time of publication.

The previous decade has provided enough reasons for a celebration, not least is the EV pioneer’s position as the most successful auto stock since its debu. Shares have skyrocketed more than 4,000% since going public.Tesla has showed no signs of slowing down, either. It crept back over the $1,000 per share mark again on its 10-year anniversary, following Elon Musk’s suggestion that a second quarter loss wasn't inevitable, after all.This remains to be seen when Tesla reports its Q2 vehicle deliveries this week. What has already been proved beyond doubt is Tesla’s ability to prove the naysayers wrong time and again. The EV pioneer is battle hardened by now, but according to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, another battle is about to commence.EV truck upstart and rival Nikola (NKLA) announced it had started taking reservations for its EV pick-up truck – the Nikola Badger - expected to hit the road in 2022. Ives argues the Badger “clearly goes after the EV leader Tesla with its Cybertruck design.”The 5-star analyst believes there is strong demand for Nikola’s new offering; the new player has built a “formidable list of preorder customers.”However, the Badger will go up against the Cybertruck, for which Ives estimates there is already a “staggering” amount of pre-orders “north of 650,000 with momentum building for this latest Musk brainchild.”Whether there’s room for both in the pickup market remains to be seen. Preorder activity for the Badger over the next few months will make it easier to gauge the impact that the new trucks can have on a market dominated by Ford and GM, with roughly 3 million pickup trucks sold every year in the US.Ives argues Tesla’s pick-up truck will have a role to play if his long-term forecasts are to be met.“Ultimately for Tesla's stock to hit our $1,500 bull case, one key component will be future success on the pick-up market, Model Y, as well as new versions/models to supplement the growth of its linchpin Model 3 design globally,” Ives summarized.To this end, Ives reiterated a Neutral rating on Tesla shares along with a $1,000 price target. This target suggests 11% downside potential from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)It appears the Wedbush analyst is in sync with the rest of the Street. TSLA's Hold consensus rating is based on 7 Buy ratings, 10 Holds and 9 Sells. The bears are in the driver's seat, as the $755.10 price target represents downside of nearly 33% over the next 12 months.

A similar update -- 2020.24.6.1 -- has already reached the cars of Tesla owners in the U.S. Most software updates become available in the states before reaching other countries.For this particular update, Canada was not far behind.Tesla's Software Update: The update includes traffic light and stop sign control changes. With the over-the-air software update, Teslas can now proceed through a green light if there is a car in front to follow -- without requiring driver confirmation.Other improvements were made to the back-up camera, dashcam viewer and door auto-lock features.An interesting omission is the ability for the interior camera in the Model 3 and Model Y to save a ""short recording"" of the cabin in the event of an accident.This feature was added to cars in the U.S. Elon Musk has said this interior camera will be used to monitor passengers in vehicles in use as a robotaxi for ride-sharing.The company may also be starting to use the interior camera to eventually enable driver monitoring via this camera. This would allow the car's driver assist features to ensure the driver is paying attention by keeping their eyes on the road.

2020-07-01 18:37:42,Tesla Surpasses Toyota To Take The Crown As World&#39;s Most Valued Automaker,TSLA,Yahoo,"Electric vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is now the undisputed leader among automakers in terms of market capitalization, thanks to the breathtaking rally in its stock seen since it bottomed in mid-March during the coronavirus-induced market meltdown. Tesla's Staggering Valuation:  Tesla's shares are valued at $208.4 billion, based on the current stock price of $1,123.65 and 185.48 million outstanding shares.In comparison, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), which held the top spot previously, has a market cap of $202.74 billion, based on the closing price of its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday.The feat is commendable for a relatively new entrant in the sector. Tesla was founded in 2003 and went public in June 2010 by offering 13.3 million shares at $17 each. Tesla's market cap breezed past the combined market cap of traditional U.S. automakers General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) in early January, when its shares hit a then-record high of $492.14, rendering the valuation at $89 billion.When debt is included, Toyota is valued at $284 billion compared to Tesla's enterprise value of $207 billion, the  Financial Times reported,  citing data from Sentieo.Tesla Catalysts Driving The Rally:  Tesla shares broke above a long-term resistance around the $385 level in mid-December 2019. After that, the stock saw a meteoric rise and peaked at $944.78 Feb. 19.The momentum in shares was supported in part by the progress Tesla was making in  China,  the hot-and-happening EV market. The company began  rolling out  the first Model 3 vehicles from its Shanghai Gigafactory in late December 2019.After turning profitable in the third quarter of 2019, Tesla reported a profit yet again in the fourth quarter. Belying expectations, the company continued its profit-generating streak and reported a surprise profit for the first quarter of 2020.The stock also received support from the news flow related to Model Y crossover SUVs, which began rolling out in mid-March, and its Cybertruck.See also:  Tesla Now China's Largest EV Manufacturer By Output: Report After the mid-February peak, the stock experienced a downturn along with the broader market in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.The stock retreated to a low of $350.51 March 18, translating to a peak-to-trough decline of about 63%.Tesla's stock took off from there at a breathtaking pace and  breached the ,000 level intraday  for the first time June 10.After moving back and forth around the mark on investor worries over a weak second quarter due to the COVID-19 impact on deliveries and production, the shares have seen a marked upward momentum in recent sessions. The stock hit new highs --both intra-day and closing -- both Monday and Tuesday, and appears on track to close at a fresh high Wednesday.Recent optimism concerning a quarter-end-push by Tesla that could lift its performance beyond expectations despite a lukewarm April-May period has generated renewed buying interest in the stock.Where Tesla Is Headed:  Tesla, being the EV pioneer, has superior technology and a competitive edge.Recently, the company announced its Model S Long Range Plus electric vehicles in North America, which have an official EPA-rated range of 402 miles.The company is also working with Chinese supplier CATL on a 1-million-mile battery. Apart from selling cars, Tesla has potential opportunity  in the form of high-margin recurring software revenue through is full-self driving advanced driver assistance system, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.Notwithstanding its prospects, the sell-side is skeptical about Tesla's heady valuation. This is reflected by the average analyst rating of Hold for the shares.TSLA Price Action: At last check, Tesla shares were rallying 4.1% to $1,124.12.

2020-07-01 20:57:46,Tesla Owner Posts Video Claiming Autopilot Saved Him From Car-Deer Collision,TSLA,Yahoo,"A Tesla owner has posted dashcam video showing his car avoiding a deer standing in the road at the last second.The owner claims autopilot saved him from having a ""very bad day,"" referring to the fact that without Autopilot, his car would have hit the deer at highway speeds.While Tesla's most basic Autopilot and safety features are standard in the car, the company recently started charging ,000 for its most expensive autonomous driving software package. What Happened: The video shows about 10 seconds of footage where the road ahead looks clear. At around the 12-second mark, a deer is suddenly visible. With not enough time to brake and traffic behind, the Tesla hits the brakes and seemingly dodges the deer at the last second by swerving into the opposite lane. After this, either the car or human correct the steering to enter back into the proper lane.All Tesla vehicles built within the last few years are surrounded by cameras that are capable of always recording. As long as the owner of the car inserts an SSD or SD card, the car is always recording everything happening around it, ready to be saved by the user in case of such an incident.The car can also be set up to continuously record when parked and sound an alarm if the car is tampered with.While Tesla vehicles have been seen doing impressive avoidance maneuvers in the past, this footage alone does not prove that Autopilot was enabled. There is no labeling on Tesla's dashcam footage, so there is no way to know if Autopilot was engaged, what speed the car was traveling, the date or any data besides what's seen in the video.Tesla Model 3 and Y vehicles do have an internal camera that has view of the driver, but this camera had not yet been enabled by Tesla at the time this video was uploaded. Benzinga's Take: Tesla vehicles are known for their impressive safety features such as emergency braking, lane departure avoidance and even dodging cars on a collision course with the Tesla.But while videos of Teslas dodging small and large animals in the road have been posted, nothing more than inconclusive dash cam footage has been presented. For the full story, an in-car camera needs to be filming the screen of the Tesla to see if Autopilot was really activated -- and at what point the driver took control. Photo courtesy of Tesla.

I am so proud to work with you!"" Musk wrote.Why It's Important: The pandemic and ultimate shutdown of California businesses was hard on Tesla, leading the CEO to make some rather controversial tweets on the matter. The company was finally on a roll with several profitable quarters in a row, including the first time Tesla has ever been profitable in a first quarter.When the pandemic hit, Tesla was forced to close its factory in Fremont, California, which is where it makes the majority of cars for worldwide distribution.Whether Tesla was able to produce and sell enough cars during the second quarter to stay profitable remains to be seen. Wall Street analysts expect Tesla to deliver 72,000 cars.Tesla shares set a new record Wednesday closing at $1,119.63, and rising another 1.64% after hours.Related Links:Tesla Surpasses Toyota To Take The Crown As World's Most Valued AutomakerTesla's Stock Closes At New Record HighPhoto courtesy of Tesla.See more from Benzinga  * Tesla Owner Posts Video Claiming Autopilot Saved Him From Car-Deer Collision  * Tesla Begins Rollout Of Software Update 2020.24.6.3 In Canada  * Tesla Raises Full Self-Driving Software Price To K As Features Mount(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-02 13:59:58,Tesla Delivery Beat Sends Shares Surging Toward Top Price Target,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. reported a sequential gain in quarterly deliveries that seemed improbable weeks ago, sending its stock surging toward Wall Street’s most bullish price target.The electric-car maker handed over 90,650 cars to customers in the three months ended in June, exceeding analysts’ average estimate for about 83,000 in a Bloomberg News survey. Tesla delivered about 88,400 vehicles in the first quarter.Tesla shares surged as much as 9.7% to $1,228 shortly after the open of regular trading, nearing the $1,250 target set Thursday by Wedbush Securities. The stock is on the verge of tripling this year.Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk overcame a roughly seven-week shutdown of Tesla’s California car plant by ramping up output at its new factory near Shanghai. Localizing production in China is helping reach more customers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market by lowering prices. The period also was the first full quarter of deliveries for the Model Y crossover, which Musk has predicted will become Tesla’s top seller.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Tesla’s Shanghai production has assumed the role of growth engine as the large addressable market of early adopters drives a surge in demand and makes China the company’s most important and voluminous market. Tesla pushed to keep its California factory open, and while demand is still virus-affected, the U.S. market is mature and no longer showing the growth that would move the company out of its niche.\-- Kevin Tynan, global autos analystClick here to read the researchWhile deliveries were down almost 5% from a year ago, that’s a strong showing relative to the declines other automakers sustained due to the global pandemic that decimated vehicle demand in key markets.“Tesla is winning because they have a product that is measurably better than both gas and electric competitors,” Gene Munster, a managing partner of venture capital firm Loup Ventures, wrote in a report. “It’s becoming more and more difficult to envision a scenario in which legacy automakers will find a way to meaningful expand the small share of EVs that they have today.”The next big question for Musk, 49, is whether the deliveries were enough to earn a quarterly profit. He suggested to employees earlier this week that avoiding a loss was possible.“Breaking even is looking super tight,” the CEO wrote to staff in an email seen by Bloomberg. “Really makes a difference for every car you build and deliver. Please go all out to ensure victory!”Musk has sent many end-of-quarter emails to rally employees and signal to investors, but Tesla hasn’t always followed through on his optimism. The then-record 97,000 deliveries Tesla reported for the three months that ended in September fell short of the 100,000 mark he floated in an email to workers.If Musk is on the mark this time, Tesla could qualify for inclusion in the S&P; 500 Index. To be eligible, the company needs to report positive quarterly earnings under generally accepted accounting principles. Beyond sales of cars, Tesla can recognize revenue related to its automated driving system, and it also sells emissions credits to other automakers.“With strong Q2 volumes, GAAP profitability is now in focus and appears achievable, which could lead to inclusion in the S&P; 500,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Robert W. Baird who rates Tesla the equivalent of a hold, wrote in a report.Analysts on average project Tesla will report a loss of about $1.80 a share on a GAAP basis for the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But higher-than-projected vehicle deliveries would make profitability a “less radical” idea, Dan Levy, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a report Monday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Musk Previews Autopilot Updates: CEO Elon Musk has been talking on Twitter this week, giving updates on the progress of the software and new features that are yet to come.Musk mentioned that that the Autopilot rewrite is going well, and almost everything in the autopilot code needed to be rewritten.This rewrite will allow Autopilot to see and interpret data in real-time 3D, much like a human, rather than seeing everything as a picture in time, the CEO said.He goes on to mention that the fruits of this labor will be seen in two to four months, when the software is ready for release and safety-tested before rolling out to the general public. One highly requested feature that Musk said will come with this rewrite is the company's ""reverse summon,"" where the car can drop its driver off at the door of their destination and then drive through a parking lot on its own to find a parking spot.When the driver is ready, they can then summon the car using the Tesla app on a mobile phone. The cars come with a feature called ""smart summon,"" where the car is able to come pick a driver up anywhere in a parking lot within approximately 200 feet of the car. Why It's Important: Autopilot software rewrites are nothing new for the Tesla team. Back in March, 2018, Teslarati noted that owners were happy with a rewrite done at the time, claiming large imporvements in handling and lane keeping.Since that time, Tesla has developed its own processing hardware in-house, giving it much more data processing power. Tesla has also delivered close to 1 million cars, giving them many more cars on the road and data points as owners drive around and send Autopilot data back to Tesla. Benzinga's Take: If Tesla wants to reach true Level 5 Autonomy, a rewrite is needed.While the tech delivered in the cars today is impressive, it is far from driving without human supervision. Owners still regularly complain of phantom braking, where the car applies the brakes for no reason or a non-existant obstacle.The smart summon feature was also a bit of a disappointment for owners. While proven safe, it is incredibly slow and still can still get confused in the simplest of scenarios.If Tesla can get lidar-like performance out of a camera-only setup with this rewrite, Autopilot doubters will be in for a big surprise.

2020-07-02 16:55:51,Tesla Skeptic Marvels at $48 Billion Boost From One Data Point,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s cars may run on batteries, but its stock price is fueled by “the power of the narrative,” according to an analyst with a sell rating on the shares.In a report Thursday, Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets marveled at how the electric-car maker has managed to add about $48 billion of market capitalization by ginning up excitement about its quarterly vehicle deliveries.On June 24, Tesla’s investor-relations team shared a collection of delivery estimates that found analysts on average were expecting the company to hand over about 70,300 vehicles to customers. The market recognized this as a low bar, triggering gains that were further supported by two bullish emails Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sent to employees that leaked to several media outlets.By the time Tesla reported 90,650 deliveries on Thursday, its shares had surged about 27% over the course of seven trading days, outpacing the S&P; 500’s roughly 3% gain. The company added more market cap in that span than General Motors Co. or Ford Motor Co.’s entire valuations.“That, is remarkable,” Spak wrote. He estimates Tesla topped consensus delivery estimates by the equivalent of about $1 billion of revenue, meaning investors are valuing the beat at about 47.5 times sales.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-02 17:32:26,Tesla Analyst Sees &#39;Major Home Run&#39; In Q2 Deliveries Despite Year-Over-Year Declines,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) failed to sustain its 2019 performance level despite new contributions from its Shanghai factory and Model Y. The automaker's second-quarter deliveries fell 4.8% year over year to about 90,650 units. Notably, the Street expected just 68,380.""In our opinion, a 90,000 delivery number in this COVID lockdown environment is a jaw dropper and the bulls will run with this as a potential paradigm changer moving ahead,"" Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note.Loup Ventures noted that peer deliveries fell significantly more dramatically -- General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) dropped 34%, Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM) 35% and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU) 39% -- and Tesla's numbers actually rose quarter-over-quarter despite 21 more days of factory shutdowns.""June quarter deliveries are further evidence that Tesla has the auto industry backed into a corner,"" Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster said in a note.Analysts On Tesla's Global Performance Wedbush, which maintained a Neutral rating on Tesla with a $1,250 price target, called the quarterly performance a ""major home run"" and honed in on strength in China.""To this point, strong Model 3 demand out of China remains a ray of shining light (and we believe was a clear standout in 2Q) for Tesla in a dark global macro and appears to be on a run rate to hit 100,000 unit deliveries in the first year out of the gates for Giga 3 which is driving some strength for Tesla as well as Model Y deliveries starting to ramp as well,"" Ives said. International sales drove a large portion of Tesla's deliveries.Based on the math from Tesla bear GLJ Research, Fremont deliveries declined about 37% year-over-year, and Models S and X deliveries fell 40%, although each surpassed consensus expectations. Founder Gordon Johnson emphasized the quarter's implications for the achievement of annual guidance.""Keep in mind, TSLA cut the price of its cars sharply several times in 2Q20, and this means they have to ship 160,700 cars in both 3Q20 and 4Q20 to hit their year-end 2020 guidance of 500K cars delivered,"" the analyst said in a note. Tesla's Production Tesla's production fell from 102,672 in the first quarter to 82,272 in the second. Models 3 and Y made up 75,946 units compared to the previous quarter's 87,282, while the S and X comprised 6,326 compared to the prior figure of 15,390.Wedbush said the turnout was ""impressive given the Fremont closure/stand-off during the quarter.""Earnings Implications For Tesla The figures may help alleviate lingering bear concerns about Tesla's sustainability, said Loup Venture's Munster. ""Based on the just reported June quarter delivery numbers, we expect the company to report better than expected earnings, potentially near a profit despite the shutdown, and favorable details on continued profitability trends driven by the Shanghai factory and Model Y.""

The carmaker’s stock climbed to a record intraday high of $1,228 earlier Thursday.In December 2018, Musk told “60 Minutes” that he did not respect the SEC. As part of his settlement agreement, he was required to pay a $20 million fine and step down as Tesla’s chairman for three years.A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-10 14:20:05,Analyst: Tesla And Nikola Are The &#39;Silent Short Seller Killers&#39;,TSLA,Yahoo,"A buying frenzy in electric vehicles stocks has Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares up 62.1% and Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ: NKLA) shares up 60% since Nikola first began trading on June 4.While EV investors are making a killing off the scramble for EV stocks, S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said short squeezes could drive significant additional upside in both Tesla and Nikola.Heavy LossesDusaniwsky said Tesla already appears to be in the middle of a short squeeze. Tesla has $19.1 billion in aggregate short interest, more than any other domestic U.S. stock. However, Tesla's short interest is down by $2.3 billion in the past 30 days, suggesting some short sellers may finally be throwing in the towel after the stock gained 508% in the past year.Nikola's short interest of $390 million is much smaller, but the two stocks have similar short percentages of float. Tesla's short percent of float is 9.5%, while Nikola's is 7.6%.Dusaniwsky said Tesla short sellers have endured $18 billion in mark-to-market losses year-to-date in 2020, with 43% of those losses coming in the past five weeks of trading. He said these heavy losses are the reason behind Tesla's short squeeze, which is already in progress.""If Tesla's stock price continues to trend upward, we expect even more short covering as mark-to-market losses accumulate,"" Dusaniwsky said.Short Squeeze Inevitable?The Nikola short squeeze has not yet begun at this point, but Dusaniwsky said skyrocketing borrow fees for the stock suggest a squeeze could be just around the corner.Nikola's stock borrow fees have spiked to around 600%, and Nikola short sellers have paid $66 million in borrow fees in the month of July alone. At current borrow costs, Dusaniwsky said Nikola short sellers need the stock to drop 1.67% daily just to break even.""If NKLA's stock price appreciates, short sellers will be big losers on both sides of the short sale profit\loss calculation - unless NKLA's stock price trends downward a short squeeze is inevitable,"" he said.Skyrocketing EV valuations have many analysts and traders as skeptical as ever about Tesla and Nikola's stock prices. However, given the market dynamics at play, both stocks make very risky short trades at this point.""It looks like electric and hydrogen car manufacturers are the silent short seller killers in the market today,"" Dusaniwsky said.Benzinga's TakeThe average Wall Street analyst price targets for Tesla and Nikola are $722.26 and $46, implying 48.2% and 19% downside, respectively. Tesla shares have roughly doubled in the two months since CEO Elon Musk tweeted ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"" back on May 1.Do you agree with this take?

2020-07-10 16:36:58,Tesla Model Y Spotted In Europe,TSLA,Yahoo,"The Tesla Model Y has been on sale in the United States for only a few months, and for less time in Canada. As Tesla ramps up production and works to meet demand, the car is expected to become available in other parts of the world.Despite not yet being available in Europe, a Model Y has been registered in Sweden, according to Electrek.The vehicle was imported to Sweden by Volvo, the publication reported. Tesla's efficiency is unmatched in the electric vehicle space. Their cars have more driving range than any of their comparable competitors, with a battery that is similar in size or smaller.These efficiencies are credited to a low coefficient of drag, as Tesla has some of the most sleek cars in the industry; lighter parts, aerodynamic wheels; and tires with low rolling resistance.Benzinga's Take: A competitor could gain a lot from taking apart one of Tesla's cars, and if they purchase it, they have the right to do whatever they like with it. With world governments increasingly moving toward sustainable energy and transport, legacy automakers need to bring electric cars that compete with Tesla's high standards if they want to remain relevant.Until then, companies like Fiat will continue to pay Tesla billions to offset their carbon footprint.

2020-07-10 16:38:55,Tesla appears poised for electrifying S&P 500 debut,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla investors, buckle your seatbelts - the red-hot stock is likely to go from the fast lane into hyper-drive. 
Having soared 500 percent over the past year - revving to record high after record high – there are two major upcoming events that could push the stock even higher. 
Tesla CEO Elon Musk reports results on July 22nd and he could cross the finish line with his fourth straight quarterly profit - something never before seen for the electric car maker. If that happens, investors are betting that will trigger another milestone....an entrance into the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
Fund managers who mimic the S&P 500 would then be forced to buy the stock. 
S&P Dow Jones - the keeper of the S&P 500 - would neither confirm nor deny plans to add Tesla to the index, but said the so-called index funds that would need to buy Tesla to replicate the S&P 500 hold at least $4.4 trillion in assets.
 And there are trillions of dollars more at stake from stock pickers who are judged by a how well they do compared to the S&P 500; they too may be forced to buy Tesla shares. 
Sounds like a one-way bet to some, but others may see it as a speed trap. 
Not only is Tesla one of the most beloved stocks on Wall Street it is also one of the most controversial, due in part to Musk’s sometime mercurial behavior. 
Investors betting against the stock have put up $19 billion - the largest-ever bet that a company's stock will fall, according to one estimate.  These naysayers point out that Tesla's entrance into the S&P 500 is far from a guarantee… And while the company may grab lots of headlines, it still sells far fewer cars than its larger rivals.  
In addition, competitors such as Porsche and General Motors are hard at work on their own electric models, hoping to eventually dim Tesla's halo and its meteoric stock price."

Rowe Price Associates, while Soros Fund Management LLC, Coatue, Fidelity Management and Research Company and Baron Capital Group also participated. Existing investors Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) were also part of this funding round.Rivian's EV Play: Rivian says the first vehicles scheduled for release are the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. On the top trim levels, the vehicles are slated to have an all-electric range of approximately 400 miles, matching Tesla's Model S. No fully electric pickup trucks are on the market today, although Tesla does offer an SUV, the Model X, which tops out at 345 miles of range.Benzinga's Take: Rivian's offerings seem to be the most compelling of any upcoming electric truck.While Nikola is going for the hydrogen angle, they do not have a factory or even a partner to start production.Tesla's Cybertruck was initially met with skepticism due to its strange looks, but has since amassed hundreds of thousands of reservations.The range of Rivian's upcoming vehicle matches Tesla's range today.The Cybertruck is advertised to top out at 500-plus miles of range. Tesla also has its battery and investor day coming Sept. 15 -- an event where the automaker will show off new battery technology that could potentially push the range of its vehicles even farther past that of their competition.Photo courtesy of Rivian.See more from Benzinga  * Tesla Model Y Spotted In Europe  * Ford's Electric Mustang Mach-E Prototype Spied In Extreme Testing  * Future Tesla Update Will Bring Side Video Feed When Using Turn Signal: Musk(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: TSLA) recently ranked as the world's most valuable transportation company.Muscling its way up the ranking, Rivian has been on a tear since last fall, when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from the Michigan-based startup.Prior to that date Rivian had positioned itself as an adventure vehicle maker, focused on an electric pickup truck, the Rivian R1T, and an electric SUV, the Rivian R1S.In total, Rivian completed four funding rounds in 2019, including a .3 billion investment led by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates.Despite production delays tied to the coronavirus pandemic, the consumer vehicles are expected to launch early next year.

His majority ownership of closely held SpaceX accounts for about $15 billion.Shares of the electric-car maker have risen 269% this year. The company’s booming valuation helped Musk land a $595 million payday, making him the highest-paid CEO in the U.S.Musk is the latest tech entrepreneur to rise above Buffett in the ranks of the world’s richest. Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft Corp. CEO, and Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Brin also have leapfrogged the Oracle of Omaha. And Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani surpassed Buffett this week.Mike Novogratz, the longtime money manager who now runs digital currency investor Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., warned that valuations of technology companies are getting way too high and that small investors should get out of the market before it crashes.“We are in irrational exuberance -- this is a bubble,” he said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview. “The economy is grinding, slowing down, we’re lurching in and out of Covid, yet the tech market makes new highs every day. That’s a classic speculative bubble.”Surpassing Buffett may be especially sweet for Musk. In an interview in May, he told comedian Joe Rogan that he wasn’t “the biggest fan” of his fellow billionaire. “He’s trying to find out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean that’s kind of a boring job, if you ask me,” Musk said.Buffett has also criticized Musk, saying last year that although Musk was “a remarkable guy,” he had “room for improvement” in behaving like a CEO, singling out his tweeting habits.Buffett’s fortune dropped earlier this week when he donated $2.9 billion to charity. The 89-year-old has given away more than $37 billion of Berkshire Hathaway shares since 2006.

The move comes less than four months after Tesla started delivering the vehicle in mid-March.It is also not the first price cut of late. Tesla reduced the price for the Model S and the Model X by $5,000 and $2,000 respectively in May.The price cuts were viewed as an “acknowledgment that Tesla isn’t immune to material North American demand weakness,” commented Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin at the time.However TSLA subsequently announced total 2Q deliveries of 90,650, well ahead of FactSet consensus of 68,380. Model S/X deliveries were 10,600, ahead of consensus’ 8,660 estimate, while Model 3/Y deliveries were 80,050 vs. consensus of 59,250 Model 3/Y.Not that RBC Capital’s Joseph Spak was too impressed. “A good overall performance in light of the pandemic, but signs of trouble for more mature markets/products” the analyst wrote.“Yes, TSLA able to show good headline numbers relative to an auto industry that really felt impact of COVID-19. But we must also remember, that TSLA benefits from entering a new market this year (yes they sold in China prior, but only started making in China in earnest this year). This of course, counts as growth, and new markets/products is part of the TSLA story” he explained.But what really stopped the analyst from taking a more positive view on Tesla stock was the price. Shares are currently trading up a whopping 270% year-to-date.“Bullishness is very high; we can’t recommend adding believing that current price more than discounts positive arguments” Spak concluded. He has a sell rating on the stock and $615 price target.Overall Wall Street analysts are sidelined on the stock’s outlook. The Hold analyst consensus breaks down into 9 Sell ratings and 10 Hold ratings versus 7 Buy ratings. In light of the recent rally, the $816 average price target now implies 47% downside potential.

When asked about a smaller European style Hatcback, Musk said, ""Probably a good one to design & engineer in Germany.""While Tesla's Model 3 starts at $35,000, and offers much more at that price than competing electric vehicles, it's still more expensive than the average purchase price of a car in America. Many owners were also disappointed that when revealed, the Model 3 didn't have a hatchback, unlike every other Tesla model sold today.> Probably a good one to design & engineer in Germany> > -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2020See Also: Elon Musk Passes Warren Buffett, Still Behind Bezos As World's Richest PersonWhy It's Important: Bringing an even lower cost, smaller Tesla could help Tesla's mission of transitioning the world to sustainable transport. This would give more people the ability to purchase a Tesla.And since electric vehicles have less moving parts, and Tesla also sells software with the cars, the company may have an easier time making a profit on these small vehicles than traditional auto manufacturers.Benzinga's Take: While many agree Tesla's Model 3 is a good price point for a smaller car, most still can't afford the base model. If Tesla truly wants all people driving an electric vehicle, a smaller, more cost-conscious option is a must. This vehicle would also do well in many parts of the world that don't have roads as big as the U.S., such as many parts of Europe and Asia.Photo courtesy of Tesla.See more from Benzinga  * Tesla Confirms New Date For Investor, Battery Day  * Rivian Raises Another .5B In Bid For Market's First Fully Electric Pickup Truck  * Tesla Model Y Spotted In Europe(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

This comes at the start of the third quarter, as the company continues to ramp up production of the all-electric crossover vehicle. Tesla has a history of reducing vehicle prices over time. Tesla's flagship Model S and X vehicles have had thousands of dollars of price drops over the years, and even the Model 3 was included in a price drop back in May. This sometimes leaves owners frustrated, although changing and lowering car prices isn't new to Tesla. Benzinga's Take: While many will speculate this shows decreased Model Y demand, this hasn't usually been the case in past price drops, especially when looking at the Model 3.Tesla's mission is to transition the world to sustainable transport, and one of the best ways to do that is to make its highly desired products more accessible by lowering the price. As Tesla becomes more efficient with its vehicle production, it can maintain its high margins while lowering prices for the customer.Photo courtesy of Tesla.See more from Benzinga  * Musk Tweet Reveals Tesla May Design Small Hatchback EV  * Tesla Confirms New Date For Investor, Battery Day  * Rivian Raises Another .5B In Bid For Market's First Fully Electric Pickup Truck(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-12 21:00:15,The Battery Billionaire Who’s Key to Tesla’s Future in China,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. needs to succeed in China if it wants to dominate the world of electric cars—especially in a post-virus world. To do that, Elon Musk is turning to a battery engineer who once helped Apple Inc. extend the life of its MacBook laptops.Zeng Yuqun, 52, built Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. into China’s battery champion in less than a decade, creating the largest global producer of rechargeable cells for the plug-in vehicles considered to be the future of cars. That effort has helped propel Zeng from a modest hillside village and $30-a-month job with a state-run company to an estimated $17 billion fortune.CATL’s products are in almost every major global auto brand, and starting this month they’ll also power electric vehicles manufactured by Tesla at its new factory on the outskirts of Shanghai. It’s an alliance with lucrative potential, combining the sector’s most-popular car—the Tesla Model 3—with low-cost batteries in a market that last year bought more than three electric vehicles for every one sold in the U.S., but faces an uncertain future as the pandemic rocks the global economy.There’s already a developing partnership between the two executives, according to Zeng. The pair trade text messages to discuss prospective innovations in technology, their responses to the challenges wrought by the coronavirus and the Tesla chief’s primary obsession: cheaper batteries and vehicles.“Elon talks about cost all day long, and I told him to be assured that I would have solutions,” Zeng said in an interview at CATL’s headquarters in Ningde, where his 20th-floor office overlooks a fishing hub on China’s southeastern coast now transformed by clusters of battery plants and laboratories. “We get along well. He’s a fun guy.”CATL’s batteries can offer the Palo Alto, California-based company key advantages in China, particularly the potential to boost margins and lower sticker prices in a market on track to have 59 million EVs on the road by 2030, even after the impact of the virus. Most importantly, Zeng is expected to supply Tesla with lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries that use a cheaper mix of raw materials and cost about 20% less to make than other common types of packs, according to BloombergNEF.Tesla and CATL—the latter confirmed in a February filing it would become a supplier to the carmaker—declined to disclose precise details, including the types of packs involved.Working with a domestic supplier like CATL could further burnish Tesla's relations with China's authorities, which have been key to its local success. What’s more, Zeng serves on the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the advisory body to top leadership. There, he’s put forward proposals to further focus on renewable energy.For CATL, the alliance comes at a crucial time. Battery sales fell almost a third in the first five months of 2020, according to SNE Research, as car purchases plunged in China amid the pandemic, trade war and a scaling back of government subsidies. Electric-car sales have declined about 38 percent from a year ago, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said July 10, and that risks exposing the country’s multi-billion-dollar EV push as a bubble.The battery producer’s domestic market share also ebbed as Tesla rolled out its first China-made Model 3s with batteries from LG Chem Ltd. and Panasonic Corp. Starting next year, CATL should supply components for about half the Shanghai plant’s output, according to Sanford C. Bernstein.Aligning with Tesla will boost domestic sales, though CATL also needs to secure additional clients to improve its prospects outside China, where LG Chem and Samsung SDI Co., among others, are positioning themselves at a rapid pace.“CATL's success is largely because of the strong demand in China,” BNEF analyst Daixin Li said. “In the future, as EV markets outside China are growing quickly, maintaining and even increasing market share in the global market will rely on how successfully it can secure demand outside China.”Read More: A Million-Mile Battery From China Could Power Your Electric CarThe battery supplier has an eye on extending links with Tesla overseas, including to the automaker’s first European factory under construction outside Berlin. CATL, which also supplies Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, is building its own facility in central Germany and encouraging China-based suppliers to set up outposts there.“We won't exclude the possibility to supply its Berlin Gigafactory,” Zeng said in the interview.Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.Zeng has delivered in the past for blue-chip partners. His team helped BMW’s China joint venture develop its early battery-powered models, and CATL now has an 11-year supply contract with the German parent. At CATL’s forerunner company, Zeng helped Apple deliver long-life batteries for the MacBook Air.The supplier now sees an advantage in accelerating research on lower battery costs to help electric-powered cars achieve price parity with, and subsequently supplant, gas guzzlers.“You have to be more innovative, more cost-efficient, with better performance,” Zeng said. “That's the only way to beat them.”CATL is poised to commercialize new types of batteries made without cobalt, among the most-expensive raw materials. Beyond that, it wants to eliminate other costly metals, such as nickel and manganese.According to Zeng, the supplier also is capable of producing a long-life battery that lasts 16 years and 2 million kilometers (1.24 million miles), and is intended for use in multiple vehicles and in energy storage. That’s a milestone others, including Tesla and General Motors Co., are chasing.More research facilities are under construction in Ningde, where entire city blocks are filled with laboratories and apartment towers for CATL staff, including the “Cloud-Capped Pavilion” neighborhood where Zeng and his wife have a top-floor home. A 3.3 billion-yuan ($470 million) research-and-development complex is intended to be a global flagship.“Incremental improvements can build a well-performing company, but not a great one,” said Zeng. A sand model of the planned center sits on the floor by his office door. “We invest in geniuses.” Zeng himself earned a doctorate in condensed matter physics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.Spending by CATL on R&D; jumped about 50% last year, to almost 3 billion yuan, and the firm has almost 5,400 staff focused on the tasks. They include 143 workers with Ph.D.s—who receive such perks as their own canteen and can take advantage of a company-run dating service that took credit for 52 marriages last year.Even before the new research hub, CATL’s efforts put it among the top tier of the industry, said Hu Feng, a partner at Shenzhen-based Gao Gong Lithium Battery Research Center who has tracked Zeng’s work for almost a decade.The sophisticated labs and new factories coming in China and Germany are a marked contrast to the makeshift production lines of Zeng’s early career. Staff members coated batteries with a paint brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other, and Zeng once used paper clips as a temporary fix to stop vibrating equipment from damaging cells.Now, staff don medical-style protective clothing to limit the spread of dust before passing through a high-pressure air shower. In a nearby lab, batteries are shaken, crushed, immersed in water for 48 hours and placed into boxes heated to 130 degrees Celsius (266 degrees Fahrenheit).“What we do is try to bring innovations to the structure and chemical system, which will enable Tesla cars to drive a longer range at a better cost,” said Zeng, leaning against an armchair in a fifth-floor meeting space decorated with a Chinese painting on the wall and a tea set on a table. “That’s probably why Tesla likes us.”By using CATL’s cheaper and smaller batteries for the Model 3, Tesla’s costs per car could fall between $600 and $1,200, according to Bernstein. LFP packs traditionally haven’t been as powerful as more expensive alternatives, yet the technology is catching up.“It could be pretty explosive if they get that in the international market because no one else is using LFP outside China in pure EVs,” said Mark Newman, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst at Bernstein. “Tesla would have a pretty meaningful advantage.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-13 07:09:36,Tesla’s Elon Musk Overtakes Buffett On Billionaires Rich List,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc. billionaire (TSLA) Elon Musk is now richer than investment guru Warren Buffett.The fortune of Tesla’s founder rose $6.1 billion on Friday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after the carmaker’s stock surged 11%. Musk is now the world’s seventh-richest person, also ahead of tech titans Larry Ellison and Sergey Brin.Buffett’s fortune fell earlier this week when he donated $2.9 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to charity. The 89-year-old has given away more than $37 billion of Berkshire shares since 2006.Musk owns about a fifth of Tesla’s outstanding stock, which makes up the lion’s share of his $70.5 billion fortune. His majority ownership of closely held Space-X accounts for about $15 billion.Shares of the electric carmaker have jumped 269% this year. The firm’s ballooning valuation helped Musk land a $595 million pay-day earlier this year, making him the highest-paid CEO in the U.S.Musk is the latest tech entrepreneur to rise above Buffett in the ranks of the world’s richest. Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) CEO, and Google (GOOGL) co-founders Larry Page and Brin also have leapfrogged the Oracle of Omaha.Tesla shares have this month already gained 43% as the carmaker reported second-quarter car deliveries, which exceeded analysts’ expectations. It delivered about 90,650 vehicles during the quarter. This compares with analysts’ estimates for about 74,130 vehicles.Looking ahead, five-star analyst Daniel Ives at Wedbush says that although investors will be focusing next on 2Q earnings on July 22, he continues to believe that Battery Day now to be held on Sept. 22 will be a major positive catalyst for the stock.“First on earnings around the corner, based on the 90k delivery number that Musk & Co. announced a few weeks ago it appears profitability is likely on the horizon and will be another major feat for Tesla in this very arduous COVID-19 backdrop,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. “While the Street reduced its annual delivery forecast to roughly 400k from its original 550k pre COVID, we now believe hitting 450k for the year could be in the cards.”The analyst though maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $1,250 price target for the base case and a $2,000 price target for the bull case. In line with Ives’s outlook, the majority of Wall Street analysts are sidelined on the stock with a Hold analyst consensus.In light of the share’s rally this year, it is not surprising that the $816.35 average analyst price target now implies 47% downside potential to current levels.

2020-07-13 09:43:34,"Tesla Sets Date For “Battery Day”, Analyst Says It Could Be ‘Game-Changing’",TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc. (TSLA) has set September 22 for its “Battery Day” event which is expected to unveil improvements to the batteries powering the automaker’s electric car technology. The event was originally scheduled for earlier in the year however it was postponed because of the pandemic. To address concerns of social distancing, the Tesla plans to live-stream the event while also offer in-person attendance to select shareholders and investors. The main focus of “Battery Day” will be for the unveiling of a new cell to power the company’s vehicles. On May 14, Reuters reported that Tesla and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. were working on a joint development project to create what is being called the “million-mile” battery. It is expected to be cheaper to produce and provide longer-lasting battery life. The average life for a current Tesla vehicle battery is less than half of that amount. Most importantly, the new battery could bring the price of Tesla’s electric vehicles down to a price-point that is comparable to gasoline-powered automobiles.The forum will address questions while also providing shareholders with the opportunity to vote and make decisions on matters such as the expansion of Tesla’s marketing strategy to advertisements. On May 28, Tesla highlighted a statement by San Diego-based shareholder James M. Danforth which said, “Advertising can increase brand value, product awareness, and interest.” He added, “Tesla ads can help mitigate and dilute substantial FUD (‘Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt’) and misinformation campaigns sponsored by competitors and detractors worldwide and steer the narrative more favorably.”Danforth’s proposal calls for at least $50 per produced vehicle to be allocated toward advertising to boost brand awareness and interest. His plan will be voted on by shareholders before the event’s product reveal.Wedbush analyst David Ives highlighted “Battery Day” on July 2 saying that Telsa has “some potentially game-changing battery developments on the horizon and Tesla's stock likely has room to run further.” He reiterated a Buy rating on the shares and a price target of $1,250, which suggests 19% downside potential.Tesla’s stock has rallied 270% year-to-date with a Hold analyst consensus that breaks down into 7 Buy ratings versus 10 Hold ratings and 9 Sell ratings. The $816.35 average price target implies 47% downside potential for the shares in the coming 12 months.

With most stocks trading at or near record highs, Loup Ventures revisited the 2020 predictions it made at the start of the year.Apple To Catch Up Other With Other FAANG Stocks? Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), though currently underperforming Amazon and Netflix, is on track to end 2020 as the best FAANG stock, Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster said in a post. The optimism is based on the belief the company will benefit this year from easy iPhone comparables, continued Apple Watch growth, the launch of five new iPhone models in 2020 and investor anticipation of 5G, Munster said.Tesla To Surpass Delivery Targets? Munster, who had predicted that Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) would exceed the original Street delivery estimate of 463,000 at the start of the year, remains optimistic the EV maker will outperform.Having  delivered  a combined 179,000 vehicles in the first half, the analyst-turned-venture capitalist said the company has to sell another 284,000 vehicles in the second half to hit the number, which would mean deliveries of 142,000 per quarter.""We believe this is possible given the ramp in China Gigafactory production, along with growing demand for Model 3 and Model Y,"" he said. Direct IPO Listings Gain Acceptance? Loup Ventures' Doug Clinton, who said he expected at least three direct listings this year as the mode gains wide acceptance, said no direct tech listings have occurred yet. Clinton noted recent reports suggesting Coinbase and Palantir are exploring direct listings.See also:  Apple Gets Another Price Target Hike, Analyst Predicts Strong Services Trends Amazon Adding 20 Go Stores?

Munster had expected Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX) to meet the Street's initial net paid adds estimate of 26.6 million.With the streaming giant reporting net paid adds of a staggering 15.8 million in the March quarter and appearing on track to beat its guidance of 7.5 million for the June quarter, Munster said the company is approaching the Street's initial full-year guidance by midyear.Apple, Facebook Unlikely to Launch AR Glasses? As Loup Ventures expected, Apple and Facebook, Inc.

2020-07-13 14:36:52,"Tesla Soars Ahead of ‘Battery Day’, India Entry, S&P Add",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s relentless surge continued Monday amid several upcoming events that include the possible unveiling of new battery technology from the electric vehicle maker, entry into a lucrative new market and the potential inclusion of the stock into the prestigious S&P; 500 Index.The company late on Friday said its much-anticipated “Battery Day” event will be held on Sept. 22, at its Fremont, Calif., factory. According to Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, Tesla could announce a number of new potential “game changing” battery developments at the event. Separately, Roth Capital upgraded the stock, saying the company is well down the path of preparing to enter the Indian market, where they see China-like potential.“The technology innovations around Fremont remain the key ingredients in Tesla’s success on the battery front and we believe the company is getting closer to announcing the million-mile battery,” Ives wrote in a note to clients.Tesla jumped as much as 16% to $,1794.99 on Monday, the biggest intraday gain since March 24.Roth analyst Craig Irwin upgraded his rating on Tesla to the equivalent of a hold from sell, saying the company is well down the path of preparing to enter the Indian market, where the analyst sees China-like potential. “We expect tangible evidence by the end of 2020, with sales in India starting as soon as 2021,” the analyst added.The incredible rally in the stock has left Wall Street analysts struggling to make sense of the sky-high valuation -- which soared past that of Toyota Motor earlier this month and topped $300 billion on Monday. Tesla shares are up about four-fold just this year, despite a steep pandemic-related selloff in February and March.Although the stock had kicked off this year with a strong run, its ascent has been turbo-charged after Tesla reported better-than-expected delivery numbers for the second quarter earlier this month, leading many to say the company may be poised to report a profit for the period.

2020-07-13 14:50:00,S&P 500 now stands within 5% of its Feb. 19 all-time closing record as stock market rallies Monday,TSLA,Yahoo,"U.S. stocks on Monday morning were rallying, with gains driving the broad-market S&P; 500 index  to within 5% of its most recent record, a move that is underscoring a rebound for the equity markets since its March collapse that had been induced by panic about the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The S&P; 500 was most recently up 1% at around 3,218, just within 5% of its Feb. 19 peak at 3,386.15, according to FactSet data. Although concerns about the economic outlook haven't evaporated, investors are continually betting that the a rise in cases derived from the novel strain of coronavirus won't significantly derail a rapid and sharp, or V-shaped, economic recovery. The broad market's elevated value also is due to stimulus from the government and the Federal Reserve, which has helped to support a rally in mega-capitalization stocks that are technology or technology related, including Amazon.com Inc. , Microsoft Inc. , Apple Inc.  and Tesla Inc.  among them, which are viewed as more resilient to the harm from business closures due to the epidemic. Those companies are also considered solid bets on the future of the economy outside of the pandemic that has rocked global economies and markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index , against that backdrop, has been on a tear, and was on track for its 28th record of 2020. The Nasdaq-100 , consisting of the largest 100 companies within the Nasdaq, also has been trading firmly in record territory. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises a number of companies considered more economically sensitive, has lagged behind its peers, but was still up firmly. The Dow  at last check was up 321 points, or 1.2%, at 26,397, but about 10% from its Feb. 12 record closing high at 29,551.42.

2020-07-13 16:48:16,Tesla’s Elon Musk Nears $2.4 Billion Haul as Stock Keeps Soaring,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- It was sold as an all-or-nothing moonshot into space, the boldest pay package in corporate history.Now, with Tesla Inc.’s stock on a seemingly unstoppable rise, Elon Musk is poised to collect the second tranche of his pay award, worth $2.4 billion.Barring a sudden drop in the electric-car maker’s shares, the final performance threshold tied to market value should be met in a matter of days. That would unlock 1.69 million stock options, yielding Musk the 10-figure sum if he were to exercise and immediately sell the shares.The remarkable payout follows an equally remarkable ride for Tesla, whose shares have more than quadrupled this year and ballooned Musk’s net worth to $70.5 billion, making him the seventh-richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The automaker is currently worth more than Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG and Hyundai Motor Co. combined.Read more: Elon Musk Soars Past Warren Buffett on Billionaires RankingThe rally has left Wall Street analysts struggling to make sense of the firm’s valuation, which topped $300 billion on Monday. Some have focused on the company’s work to improve batteries or the prospect that it may soon start selling cars in India.Tesla is scheduled to release second-quarter results July 22. If it reports a profit, it would be the fourth consecutive such quarter -- a milestone needed to be considered for inclusion in the S&P; 500 Index.Ambitious TargetsMusk, 49, has never accepted a salary, with his pay instead consisting of option awards that he can collect only if the California-based company meets ambitious targets.The most recent iteration, unveiled in early 2018, was the largest-ever corporate pay deal struck between a company’s board and its chief executive officer. It includes 20.3 million options, split into 12 tranches, that could yield Musk more than $50 billion if all goals are met, according to Tesla’s estimates.Getting all of it, however, is far from certain. Each tranche is tied to specific targets for revenue, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as well as Tesla’s average trailing market capitalization over 30 days and six months. The first market-value threshold was set at $100 billion, with the others following in $50 billion increments.Tesla reached its first milestones for sales and Ebitda -- $20 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively -- last year. And its 30-day market value average has been well above the $150 billion threshold for some time. Once the six-month average exceeds that level, Musk will claim the 1.69 million options and can exercise them at will.Musk said on Twitter last week that he could cash in on some of his stock eventually to further the mission of his other most high-profile company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Tesla's move comes just four months after the Model Y's launch, and it follows price cuts in May on its Models 3, X, and S. The company did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Model Y crossover will face competition from European nameplates like Volkswagen which are rolling out their own electric versions. 
In April, just one month after it began delivering the Model Y, Tesla said that SUV was already making money. That marked the first time in the company's history that one of its new vehicles had gone into the black in its first quarter.

The size of the vehicle is expected to be similar to Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's (OTC: BAMXF) Mini Cooper or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (NYSE: FCAU) Fiat 500. According to Irwin, the vehicle's sale in India could start as soon as 2021. He expects tangible evidence regarding the automaker's plans to emerge by the end of this year.Why It MattersTesla CEO Elon Musk, responding to a Twitter user asking about the arrival of Model 3 in India last week, said, ""hopefully soon.""> Sorry, should hopefully be soon!> > -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2020The billionaire entrepreneur also suggested in another tweet that the automaker could consider designing and manufacturing a smaller hatchback than its Model Y for countries with smaller roads than the United States at its upcoming Berlin plant.

2020-07-14 11:35:43,"Tesla’s Furious Rally May Have Another 55% Upside, Analyst Says",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. gained premarket Tuesday, rebounding from Monday’s rare decline, and at least one analyst is telling investors the dizzying rally isn’t over yet.“Is it time to redeploy capital after an amazing run? Resoundingly, we think the answer is NO,” Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note. “In our view, Tesla is the most consequential company in the mobility ecosystem, and this is unlikely to change in the next decade.”Potter lifted his price target to $2,322, the highest among the 30 analyst targets tracked by Bloomberg, from $939, a target he’s held since April. The new price target implies another 55% of upside over the next 12 months.Tesla gained 4.2% to $1,560 in premarket trading, setting it up to erase Monday’s 3.1% dip. No stranger to volatility, the stock has been on a relentless rally, more than tripling since the start of the year and advancing 60% in the past month alone. That compares to a 21% gain in the high-flying Nasdaq 100 for the year, or 9.7% in the past month.The reasons behind the gains aren’t always clear. Improving operations and profitability, a potential for “game-changing” battery technology at an upcoming event, short covering and a potential inclusion in the S&P; 500 Index have all helped push the price higher.The surge has added $202.3 billion to its market value -- or more than Exxon Mobil’s entire market cap these days -- and propelled it to displace Toyota Motor Corp. as the world’s biggest carmaker by stock value. An average of 17.7 million shares have traded hands daily since the beginning of the year, more than double the activity in the same period last year.Much of the trading has come from retail investors clamoring to get into the growing electric vehicle space. On the Robinhood trading app, more than 40,000 accounts took positions in Tesla in a single four-hour span on Monday. It was the 10th most popular stock on the platform.Still, not everyone is cheering the run. The stock last week was poised to cross $20 billion in short interest bets, the first to do so, according to data from S3 Partners. Amid the rally, the skeptics have suffered more than $18 billion in mark-to-market losses, including $4.1 billion in losses in July alone.“If Tesla’s stock price continues to trend upward, we expect even more short covering as mark-to-market losses accumulate,” S3 said in its July 9 report.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Last year Tesla opened its first plant outside the US in Shanghai.Shares in Tesla are climbing 6% in Tuesday’s pre-market trading, with the electric vehicle maker now up a whopping 265% year-to-date. The rally has continued unabated following strong second-quarter car deliveries, which exceeded analysts’ expectations. It delivered about 90,650 vehicles during the quarter, easily beating the estimated 74,130 figure.Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter has just boosted his price target on Tesla to $2,322 from $939 while reiterating his buy rating. According to Potter, Tesla is the “most consequential company in the mobility ecosystem, and this is unlikely to change in the next decade.” He recommends investors hold on to shares, noting the company’s significant software opportunity and faster-than-expected share gains.Looking ahead, five-star analyst Daniel Ives at Wedbush says that although investors will be focusing next on 2Q earnings on July 22, he continues to believe that Battery Day now to be held on Sept. 22 will be a major positive catalyst for the stock.“First on earnings around the corner, based on the 90k delivery number that Musk & Co. announced a few weeks ago it appears profitability is likely on the horizon and will be another major feat for Tesla in this very arduous COVID-19 backdrop,” Ives told investors.However, the analyst maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $1,250 price target. Like Ives the majority of Wall Street analysts are sidelined on the stock with a Hold analyst consensus. In light of the share’s rally this year, the $905 average analyst price target now implies 39% downside potential to current levels.

(See his track record here.)That doesn't mean it's time to sell the stock, the analyst said.

2020-07-14 14:31:10,Tesla Euphoria Powers Equity Boom for Electric Imitators,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s eye-popping run has left stock prognosticators in the dust, brought smaller imitators along for the ride and triggered a race by entrants new and old to cash in.It’s a phenomenon that alarms valuation experts and even gives pause to those who stand to gain from the electric-car euphoria. The companies whose shares are surging along with Tesla’s are a long way from the sales volume achieved by Elon Musk -- and his automaker is coming off a quarter in which vehicle deliveries shrank from a year ago and remain far short of the world’s top-producing manufacturers.This week’s trading has been a microcosm of just how fleeting momentum can be even for the world’s most successful EV company. Tesla’s stock soared 16% during Monday’s session, abruptly fell and then finished down 3%, shedding $55 billion of market capitalization in the process. Retail investors -- including the 10,000 users an hour who were adding shares on the investing platform Robinhood during a stretch -- likely were burned in the process.On Tuesday, the stock traded up as much as 6.2% and down as much as 4.4% within the first hour of New York trading. Shares of NIO Inc. and Nikola Corp. also pared their big gains for the year.Investors valued Nikola as high as $28.8 billion last month, despite the company being a year away from producing its first battery-powered semi truck. Two other electric-vehicle makers are now trying to replicate its reverse-merger listing strategy, with one being led by the founder of an EV maker that went bankrupt less than seven years ago.“There’s a lot of delirium,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Each company is looking up the ladder: Tesla is the next Amazon, Nikola is the next Tesla, and so on.”Damodaran said he doubts that each new entrant will be able to pull off their growth projections and that the electric-vehicle market is not big enough for every one of the companies to succeed. “We are all now reaching for a dream,” Damodaran said, “and that’s not the way to invest.”Signs of the TimesFor almost all of Monday’s roller-coaster ride, Tesla shares traded above $1,500, where the two most optimistic analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had set their fair-value estimates just last week. A new biggest bull emerged after Monday’s close, though Piper Sandler & Co.’s Alexander Potter signaled some expectation of client pushback. He ended the title of his report: “Defending Our New $2,300+ Price Target.”RBC Capital Markets analyst Joe Spak nodded to the heady times for the clean-transportation sector with a report initiating coverage of Nikola last week that asked: “Can Zero Emissions Remain Zero Gravity?” He rated the stock the equivalent of a hold, calling the company “still more of a business plan than business.”After Nikola, the most valuable U.S.-listed electric-auto entrant is NIO Inc., the Chinese maker of battery-powered SUVs. Through June, it’s handed over less than 50,000 vehicles in the roughly two years since it started delivering vehicles. But its stock has surged 244% this year.Then there’s Workhorse Group Inc., which is trying to produce and sell just 400 electric delivery vehicles this year. Its shares started surging in the run-up to Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to a politically significant factory that an affiliate acquired from General Motors Co. and is trying to revive. The stock is up 408% year-to-date.Few SurvivorsInvestors are rewarding these companies based on their business plans, but Tesla may prove to be the exception rather than the rule when it comes to mass-producing, retailing and servicing vehicles. They face an uphill battle getting the cash they need to compete with Tesla and major carmakers, said Tony Posawatz, a consultant who led development of GM’s plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt.“It’s a craze,” said Posawatz, who’s on the board of Lucid Motors Inc., which is trying to start producing its debut electric sedan by year-end. “There are 20-something EV startups in the U.S. Knowing the history of the industry, the kind of capital needed, I’ll say Tesla and two or three others will survive.”Lucid handed majority ownership to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in exchange for a $1.3 billion investment last year. That haul pales in comparison to the roughly $4.85 billion Rivian Automotive Inc. has brought in since early 2019 from the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Ford Motor Co. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.Cautionary TaleFisker Automotive, the EV startup founded before the global financial crisis by decorated auto designer Henrik Fisker, offers a cautionary tale of just how difficult the auto business can be. The company generated buzz by getting its snazzily styled Karma hybrid onto the driveways of celebrities including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio back when Musk was still getting Tesla off the ground. But it went bankrupt in 2013, losing U.S. taxpayers $139 million.China’s Wanxiang Group acquired the company out of Chapter 11 and renamed it Karma Automotive. Last week, it announced having raised $100 million from outside investors and plans to seek an additional $200 million. Chief Strategy Officer Greg Tarr said that he’s getting plenty of incoming calls but turning down some offers from opportunists who are just chasing a hot trend and don’t understand Karma’s business model.“I would say there’s too much enthusiasm,” Tarr said in a phone interview. “You have some investors that don’t have any knowledge of the EV space and aren’t asking proper due-diligence questions.”Seeking RedemptionFor Fisker, 56, his ticket to redemption could be to follow in Nikola’s footsteps. Fisker Inc., his second EV venture, announced Monday that it too plans to combine with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, in a deal that could generate more than $1 billion of proceeds and fund the development of an electric SUV called the Ocean, which is slated for production in late 2022.The Fisker deal with Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp. is the third time in the last four months that an EV company has sought to go public via a SPAC transaction. After Nikola’s deal closed in June, Hyliion Inc., a maker of electrified powertrains for semi trucks, announced it was planning to combine with Tortoise Acquisition Corp.Whereas Tesla has gone its own way after doing joint-venture projects in its early years with Toyota Motor Corp. and Daimler AG, the new entrants listing their shares by way of SPACs all are going to lean heavily on incumbents for the foreseeable future.Nikola has a joint venture with commercial-vehicle maker CNH Industrial NV and has said it will need to team up with a to-be-named manufacturer for a planned pickup. Hyliion plans to be a supplier to manufacturers of big rigs. And Fisker is negotiating with Volkswagen AG to use the German giant’s electric-vehicle platform for its SUV.(Updates with Tuesday trading in the fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-14 15:01:38,"Traders Set Record Bets on Amazon, Chinese Stocks Jumping Higher",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Beneath the surface of the highest-flying stock markets in the world, animal spirits keep rampaging like rarely seen before.Even as tech investors pause for breath after powering U.S. benchmarks from Covid lows, Amazon.com Inc. is still seeing historic demand for call contracts so bullish they only have an estimated one-in-ten chance of paying off.With the company’s shares up 66% this year, traders are bidding up the price of options that have it jumping another 50% in the next three months. Contracts betting on the online retailer to reach $4,600 by October were among the most-traded calls for that expiry month on Monday.The speculative frenzy is a similar story for Twitter Inc. and Tesla Inc. -- all signs that options traders see value in wagering that the biggest stock winners will keep winning.Fresh risk appetite is on display in another momentum-driven market eliciting cheers and fears on Wall Street. Demand for bullish contracts on a $3.5 billion China exchange-traded fund has jumped by the most ever in the wake of that country’s euphoric stock rally, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.With potential losses capped at the amount paid for call options, many investors see little risk in shelling out for bets on more windfall gains.“It’s all FOMO related,” Susquehanna’s derivatives strategist Chris Murphy wrote in an email. “Skeptical about buying after a rally but don’t want to miss out on further upside.”In Amazon stock trading, the implied volatility of way out-of-the-money calls has surged to a record relative to at-the-money contracts -- a sign of outsize bullish demand in a key corner of the derivatives market.Traders are also chasing fresh upside in Chinese equities after the country’s influential state media stoked bullish enthusiasm. Call skew, a measure of the implied volatility of calls versus puts, has jumped by a record for BlackRock Inc.’s iShares China Large-Cap ETF, or FXI, according to Credit Suisse.“The last time we saw such a dramatic bid for upside calls was in April 2015, after FXI surged 24% in a month, leading to an euphoric chase in the options market,” Mandy Xu, equity derivatives strategist, wrote in a note. “Unfortunately, the rally proved to be short-lived, with FXI falling 3% in the month after and over 20% in the following three months.”With Monday’s reversal in the mega caps and technical momentum measures stretched, there are good reasons for caution. One measure of implied volatility for the Nasdaq 100 index, derived from call and put contracts, has climbed by 8 points in the past week even as the benchmark has advanced.Still, with the put-call ratio for the tech gauge on Friday slumping to the lowest since March, speculative mania seems to be overshadowing hedging activity.“This appears to be true upside panic/FOMO ahead of earnings this month,” Murphy wrote in a note.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-14 15:56:14,"Several Fundamental Risks Overlooked As Tesla Approaches $2,000: Morgan Stanley",TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares have shown gravity-defying momentum as they reach new record highs in successive sessions. The Tesla Analyst:  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has an Underweight rating on Tesla with a $740 price target -- and a bull case price target of $2,070.The Tesla Thesis:  Tesla shares have simultaneously shown higher price, higher volatility and higher average daily volume, Jonas said in a Tuesday note. (See his track record here.)The market has disproportionately ascribed a very large share of the electric vehicle market and connected car ecosystem value chain to one single company, the analyst said.This is despite companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) allocating capital to EV/autonomous vehicle transport in a vertically integrated/full-stack approach, he said. A closer look at the hiring, patents,  acquisitions  and strategies of some of the world's largest tech firms suggests that down the line, these companies will provide their operating system to many auto OEMs at virtually no cost, Jonas said.The analyst is of the view that battery companies will provide high-quality, long-range and highly commoditized batteries to a wide range of EV manufacturers.Tesla bulls are buying into the stock based on certain assumptions, including cordial relations between China and the U.S. on trade and intellectual property in the long-term; legacy auto OEMs failing to produce a competitive EV product; big tech platforms holding back from exploring compelling EV systems; and  autonomous  driving producing substantial service revenues, he said. As opposed to investor optimism, Morgan Stanley is concerned about Sino-U.S. relations, especially with respect to autos. Jonas also expects legacy players to plow $400 billion to $500 billion into EVs over the next five years.""We expect big tech (established and clean sheet start-ups) to enter transport as a significant competitive force in EVs."" The analyst is also cautious on the pace of adoption of full autonomy as a percentage of miles traveled over the next decade.Tesla's valuaiton discounts over 5 million units of volume at a $50,000 ASP by 2030 with a relatively high combined EBITDA margin of about 20%, according to Morgan Stanley. TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were trading 1.53% higher at $1,520.04 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2020-07-14 15:58:05,"In Rivian, Amazon May Have  &#39;Bespoke Automobile&#39; At Its Service",TSLA,Yahoo,"* Amazon's investment in electric truck maker Rivian helps secure e-giant's future as a carbon neutral logistics platform.  * The investment gives Rivian edge over electric vehicle competitorsRivian's recent $2.5 billion fundraise accelerates Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) path to zero-emissions logistics domination, analysts said, while simultaneously opening up a new front in the battle to bring electric vehicles to market.""For Amazon, this creates a potential to do even greater vertical integration and create a new kind of system, where they have a bespoke automobile for their purposes,"" Michael Ramsey, a VP, an analyst with Gartner's Automotive and Smart Mobility division told FreightWaves. ""It's very interesting from that perspective.""To date, Amazon has led or participated in at least three Rivian financing rounds, including a $700 million chunk of cash the e-commerce and cloud services giant sank into the electric truck and SUV startup in February 2019. Amazon also participated in Rivian's latest $2.5 billion funding round, announced last week.And that's not all. In addition to capitalizing on the Michigan-based startup, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian. That combination — a massive financial investment plus an outsize product order —  has catapulted Rivian to the front of the pack among electric vehicle startups, according to some analysts, even giving it an edge over leading contender Tesla.""When Tesla was young, they struggled with getting big suppliers to commit,"" said Ramsey, ""so it was difficult to get off the ground because there wasn't any certainty they would have the volume that suppliers need.""With Amazon's investment, Rivian ""is almost certain to be able to produce a product, and then that product has a set of buyers.""Tesla was founded in 2003 and is still not profitable, Ramsey observed, while the other high-profile electric startup, Nikola, publicly-traded and now worth a lot of money, doesn't have a manufacturing plant, a backer from major entities or a product.Rivian's Zero-Emissions A Lure For AmazonThe Rivian stake gives Amazon the opportunity to do more than consolidating operations. Facing mounting criticism over the environmental impact of its e-commerce and data services operations, Amazon in June announced a billion investment fund focused on ""sustainable and decarbonizing technologies."" Logistics and transportation technologies were identified as one of the top priorities.Simultaneously, Amazon announced it would speed up by five years — to 2025 — a previously announced effort to power its operations with renewable energy sources. The company reaffirmed another earlier commitment to be carbon neutral by 2040.One month later, Amazon upped its investment in Rivian.""Amazon has a vested interest in securing its future as a sustainable (ultimately carbon neutral) logistics platform,"" wrote Morgan Stanley in a research note commenting on last Friday's Rivian raise.""In our opinion, Amazon is in a position to take significant steps to push the adoption of zero-emission and sustainable technologies in its ecosystem, and this has driven the company's investment [in Rivian.]""Shifting Markets, Consumer Vs. Commercial VehiclesBrittain Ladd, a former Amazon executive who now runs his own consultancy, speculates that Amazon, facing tremendous logistics pressure tied to skyrocketing e-commerce demand, will ""seriously consider"" acquiring Rivian. The giant's decision to purchase self-driving vehicle startup Zoox last month has shown that Amazon is not averse to acquiring companies outright to give it the logistics capabilities it needs. But Ladd's theory hinges on the market for electric SUVs and pickups  — ""the most popular vehicles in the U.S."" He believes Tesla will accelerate its ability to bring those consumer products to market, possibly acquiring Jeep from Fiat Chrysler or Ford's F-150 brand, or by signing a strategic partnership making Tesla the exclusive manufacturer of electric power trains for Ford pickups.""Amazon definitely sees the value in Rivian as a manufacturer of vans for Amazon in addition to Rivian's consumer business,"" he said. But a Tesla partnership with an original equipment manufacturer would reduce Rivian's value, he added, and lead Amazon to hit the pause button on a possible Rivian acquisition.Rivian: A more refined TeslaRamsey said Rivian will likely prioritize production of the Amazon delivery van, ""the money maker.""""From a market perspective, the SUV they've produced is going to get people's attention, and the commercial product for Amazon is the one that is going to pay the bills.""Characterizing Rivian as a ""more refined Tesla,"" in part because it acts like more of a traditional automaker, (and, perhaps, because it doesn't have notoriously outspoken Elon Musk as a CEO), Ramsey reiterated his position on Rivian's future.Amazon's investment may not guarantee Rivian's success, he said. ""But it guarantees longevity.""Related Stories:Amazon targets climate change with B VC fundAmid a pandemic, Amazon pivots — and profitsClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Linda Baker.See more from Benzinga  * Daily Infographic: COVID-19 Port Detentions  * Freight Futures Weekly Curve: 7/13  * AI, Human Trafficking And Border Busts (With Video)(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

A new biopic on the late 19th and early 20th-century inventor from whom they take their names suggests Nikola Tesla saw the world they envision.IFC Films expects to release ""Tesla"" on Aug. 21. The biopic premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival.Hollywood Reporter reviewer David Rooney says director Michael Almereyda created an ""aptly livewire account of an unknowable outsider whose ideas about a world connected by wireless technology now make him seem like a field-leading visionary.""As an electrical and mechanical engineer and futurist, Tesla is best known for contributing to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electrical supply. Trevor Milton, whose Nikola Corp. startup expects to sell battery-electric over-the-road trucks in Europe in 2021, tweeted a 164th birthday shoutout last Friday.Hawke called brilliant in Tesla role Veteran actor Ethan Hawke, whose earlier films include ""Training Day"" and ""Dead Poets Society,"" portrays Tesla, the Serbian immigrant who worked for — and against — American inventor Thomas Edison.Kyle MacLachlan plays Edison, who scoffed at Tesla's AC ideas when Tesla briefly worked for him.Rooney calls the film ""commercially challenging, though the brilliant, intensely contained performance of Ethan Hawke in the title role, losing himself in an introverted man accurately described as living in his head, will be a strong selling point."" ‘Solitude Of The Restless Thinker'The 2017 historical drama ""The Current War"" touched on the Edison-Tesla relationship. In that film, Benedict Cumberbatch played Edison competing with George Westinghouse over which the electric power delivery system would prevail in the United States. As Tesla, Hawke gets credit for the immigrant's achievements and his failures. ""But the film,"" Rooney writes, ""also digs into the solitude of the restless thinker, ingeniously employing as narrator Anne Morgan, [played by Eve Hewson], a woman whose unreciprocated love for Tesla doesn't cloud her perceptive read on the self-sabotaging pride that existed alongside his heightened abilities.""As the daughter of banking magnate J.P. Morgan, Hewson's character tells of Tesla's childhood experience of seeing sparks shoot from the back of his black kitten as he stroked its fur. He recalled that occurrence while watching lightning crack the sky during a thunderstorm, prompting him to wonder: ""Is nature a gigantic cat, and if so, who strokes its back?""European Reserve Meets American BrashnessRooney describes Anne Morgan's view of the rivalry between Tesla and Edison. Tesla's old-world European reserve clashed with Edison's American brashness.""Tesla appears quietly appalled by Edison's greed, his fingers in so many developmental pies that he was simply too busy to give the scientific and mathematical calculations behind AC the serious consideration to make him understand that it could work,"" Rooney wrote.The film is more soulfully philosophical than focused on a science lesson.""Almereyda [the director] isn't aiming to illuminate all the details of the inventor's work, rather to capture the infinite scope of his curiosity about technological innovations that suggest he was dreaming of the world in which we now live.""Click for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.Photo by Pixabay from Pexels. Related articles:Tesla shares crack $1,500 as the stunning run continuesTesla tops Toyota as world's most valuable transportation companyProfit-taking early investors hammer Nikola stock price See more from Benzinga  * FMCSA To Request Safety Data On Last-Mile Delivery  * KLM Gets EU Blessing For Dutch Emergency Aid  * Moroun, Whose Company Controlled P.A.M.

2020-07-14 17:20:27,"German Court Says Tesla&#39;s &#39;Autopilot,&#39; &#39;Full Self Driving&#39; Ads Misleading",TSLA,Yahoo,"Back in October of 2019, a German consumer protection agency, Wettbewerbszentrale, filed an injunction against Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) accusing the automaker of misleading naming in its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software.What Happened: Electrek reports Tuesday that Wettbewerbszentrale has judged the software names as being misleading.Tesla stock did not seem to respond negatively to the news and was trading 0.86% higher at $1,510 at the time of publication. The decision prevents Tesla from including ""full potential for autonomous driving"" and ""autopilot inclusive"" in German advertising, according to Reuters. Tesla can appeal the decision. The court said buyers could have the impression the car can drive without human intervention or that such an arrangement is legal in Germany, the newswire said. Autopilot comes standard on all Tesla vehicles and allows lane keep assist and traffic-aware cruise control that many see as the industry's best. Full Self-Driving enables more advanced features, such as self-parking and Tesla's Smart Summon, which will allow the car to return to the driver almost anywhere in a parking lot.Tesla recently increased the purchase price of its Full Self-Driving software after releasing new abilities that allow the cars to interact with traffic lights and stop signsBenzinga's Take: While the name Full Self-Driving can hard to defend, Autopilot has never seemed like a problem.After all, people are paying tens of thousands of dollars for these cars, and then adding another $8,000 to the purchase price for the privilege of using the Full Self-Driving software.Most people probably don't make that big of a purchase without knowing what they're buying. On top of that, the car gives numerous warnings before enabling the feature and also warns every time it's turned on that the driver is fully responsible.While people may be disappointed when they learn the car is not fully autonomous, changing the name will not most likely not change a person's behavior once they start driving.Photo courtesy of Tesla.See more from Benzinga  * Tesla China May Be Increasing Hiring, Possibly In Preparation For Made In China Model Y  * Expansion At Tesla Fremont Factory Shows Possible Increased Model Y Production Capacity  * Tesla Reduces Model Y Price By ,000(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-14 22:57:23,Tesla’s Texas Plant Deal Advances With County Incentive Approval,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Texas is moving forward with efforts to woo Tesla Inc. and lure its next electric-vehicle factory after the county that’s home to the state capital signed off on a tax-relief package.Commissioners in Travis County voted Tuesday to approve a 70% property-tax rebate on the first $1.1 billion the company invests in a site near Austin. The abatement is worth at least $13.9 million.The areas of Austin and Tulsa, Oklahoma, are the finalists for landing the facility where Tesla plans to build the Cybertruck pickup that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk first unveiled late last year. He has said on Twitter that the site also will supplement production of Model Y crossovers already being made at the company’s lone U.S. car-assembly plant in Fremont, California.Tesla has told Travis County that its planned factory will eventually employ 5,000 full-time workers with an average salary of roughly $47,000 a year. At least half of those will be county residents.The weeks-long effort to secure the abatement from the Austin area has played out as Musk, 49, has openly tweeted about the level of support the city of Tulsa and state of Oklahoma have offered. He visited the area on July 3, and Governor Kevin Stitt shared photos the next day of the small contingent who welcomed the billionaire to town.Nate Jensen, a government professor at the University of Texas-Austin, said securing county-level abatements could be a step toward Tesla eventually accessing bigger forms of support from the state, including from Texas Enterprise Fund, one of the largest payers of economic-development incentives in the nation.“They’ll promise the world to the county -- high environmental and wage standards, yearly audits -- and then as soon as they get other, larger incentives, they’ll back out of city incentives,” Jensen said.The other incentives the county is offering Tesla include a $46.4 million property-tax break from the local school district over ten years and an $80 million cap on the taxable value of the plant. If Tesla follows through with the project, it will be one of the largest economic-development agreements in Austin history.Landing the factory would be a major boost to an area that saw its unemployment rate surge to 11.6% in May from 2.6% in February, with more than 81,000 losing their jobs in the midst of coronavirus-related shutdowns across the country. Half of those were earning less than $30,000 a year before being laid off from leisure and hospitality jobs, according to the Texas Workforce Commission.Thousands of jobs would quickly open up for the start of construction, which Tesla wants to initiate this quarter.The project hasn’t been unequivocally supported by all. Labor leaders and progressive groups urged the five-member board of commissioners to take their time and negotiate the best deal possible, calling for elected officials to ask for in-writing worker protections and a guarantee of a $15-an-hour wage for all employees.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-15 00:42:52,How to Turn Negative Equity Into a $30 Billion Market Cap,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For weeks, those of us in Asia watched the U.S. stock frenzy with amazement — how a video game-like trading interface could lure millennials, cost fortunes and some even their lives; how Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk became richer than Warren Buffett; and why on earth retail investors were rushing to buy shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc., even though the car rental company had filed for bankruptcy. Well, gawk no more. The mania has landed in Hong Kong, too. Take a look at Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd., a healthcare facilities provider under the umbrella of real estate giant China Evergrande Group. Its stock price has soared more than 200% this year, with most of the gain notched in July. That’s resulted in a market cap as high as $30 billion this week. The catalyst is not its Elderly Care Valley business, which operates specialized centers, but its electric vehicle operations, accounting for only 12% of sales last year. There’s little news on Evergrande Health — it isn’t even covered by the sell-side equity analysts Bloomberg polls — but some investors have latched onto this stock as a Tesla play. Its parent company has the grand ambition to be more Tesla than Tesla, vowing to become the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles. Since late 2018, Evergrande has spent billions on an array of EV-related companies. Goodwill, accrued upon a series of acquisitions, came in at 6.2 billion yuan ($885 million), or 17% of the company’s non-current assets at the end of 2019.Never mind that Evergrande has yet to release its first pure battery vehicle under the flagship Hengchi brand — that deadline was already pushed back once — or that its factories in Guangdong and Shanghai won’t start production until 2021. That Tesla stock could draw 40,000 Robinhood users in a four-hour window shows there’s enough appetite for anything remotely like the U.S. market darling. Investors may also feel reassured now that Evergrande Health owns National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB, an EV maker that acquired Saab Automobile in 2012. It also has a joint venture with Koenigsegg Automotive AB, a top-tier supercar manufacturer. If anyone bothered to look at the company’s financials, though, they’d quickly get cold feet. According to its latest annual report, “equity attributable to owners of the company” was negative 1.3 billion yuan. In other words, while stock investors think Evergrande Health is worth $30 billion, an accountant could reckon that this company has zero value to shareholders. Building electric vehicles from scratch is an expensive endeavor. Evergrande Health’s negative equity stems from the fact that it has accrued 94.7 billion yuan in debt. Its parent, for instance, has provided a three-year, 32.2 billion yuan loan due next July, with interest rates ranging from 7.6% to 8%. Last year, finance costs in the EV business alone came in at 2.2 billion yuan, or 2.6 times the profit generated from the healthcare segment. As a result, Evergrande Health has no price-to-earnings, or price-to-book, to speak of — both are negative. But then liquidity and policy-driven markets can create very strange phenomena. Speculative capital flows have have already arrived in Hong Kong — just look at the stronger local dollar, which by ordinary logic would have weakened as U.S. moved to strip the city of its special status. Trading will become even cheaper, too. Huatai International Ltd., the Hong Kong arm of China’s third largest broker, is no longer charging commissions.Meanwhile, animal spirits returned to China’s $9.7 trillion stock market in July. At this market cap, Evergrande Health can just do a secondary listing on the mainland if it’s short on cash, without having to prove to regulators that it has an “edge” or “world-leading technology.” A sky-high valuation in China, in turn, would support its Hong Kong-listed shares, one could argue. Hong Kong’s stock market is an interesting hybrid, part-American because of the Hong Kong dollar peg, and part-Chinese because many mainland companies list there. Now that both U.S. and China markets have gone into a trading frenzy, it's only natural that Hong Kong will catch up. So don’t be surprised if more Tesla wannabes start cropping up. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.

2020-07-15 09:00:18,A Stay-at-Home Stock Market Kept Investors Afloat,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The coronavirus stock market, like Covid-19 itself, is something never experienced before. Get used to it.Since March, when the global pandemic became an American catastrophe, the U.S. economy has been a shadow of its 2019 self. Yet some of the most-followed measures of equity set records while an explosion in infections showed no sign of peaking and the 14.7% unemployment rate in April was the worst since the Great Depression. The seeming contradiction of simultaneous exuberance and disaster reflects a durable change in the way investors look at U.S. companies even as wishful politicians yearn to return to an old normal.The market’s best performers are champions of remotely engaged commerce quite different from most of the companies comprising the favorite benchmarks, which lag by comparison. There’s nothing surprising about the five biggest contributors to the stock market’s resilience this year because they happen to have the greatest weighting in the Bloomberg U.S. Large-Cap Price Return Index, and their products and services facilitate online communication and transactions: Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. Another smattering of high-profile U.S. companies such as Zoom Video Communications Inc., Netflix Inc., Roku Inc. and Twitter Inc. have also had rising stock prices during the pandemic because of the popularity of the services they offer to people working and playing at home.But the top 10 winners among the largest 500 U.S. companies during the second quarter increasingly are setting the course as a new breed of stay-at-home stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York City-based Datadog Inc., up 142%, provides tools for monitoring infrastructure, application performance and log management for cloud computing firms and music-streaming companies. San Francisco-based cloud-computing powerhouse Twilio Inc. is up 145%. Stockholm's Spotify is up 113%.San Francisco-based Square Inc., up 100%, and San Jose-based PayPal, up 82%, provide digital and mobile payment services, enhancing online payments. DocuSign Inc., up 86%, provides electronic signature solutions, reducing the need for in-person contract signing meetings. Santa Monica-based Snap Inc., up 98%, provides social media services, enabling communication throughout the Internet. Every one of these companies can be a customer of Sunnyvale, California-based CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., up 80%, which provides cybersecurity platforms to protect against attacks.Palo Alto, California-based Tesla Inc. appreciated 106% in the second quarter and became the largest automaker earlier this month with a market capitalization of $278 billion. Climate change and Covid-19 paved the way for this avatar of the technology-driven economy, characterized by remote engagement and artificial intelligence. With its battery-powered, zero-emission vehicles,Tesla is the undisputed leader in online sales, touchless delivery and perpetually downloaded vehicle enhancements.Shares of the 500 largest U.S. companies measured by market capitalization gained 44% between late March and mid-June after declining 24% when the pandemic first struck. Although the market remains higher than at almost any point prior to 2020, the S&P; 500 rally this year is unlike any preceding it, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Since March, fewer than 10 of the biggest companies hit their 52-week high on a daily basis. The figure was 31 in 2019, 27 in 2018, 40 in 2017, 24 in 2016 and 21 in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only way the S&P; 500 could advance with so much disappointment throughout corporate America is with a small group of exceptional companies led by Tesla.During the two years prior to 2020, when the U.S. expansion became the longest on record, the stock market’s top 10 performers included medical equipment designer DexCom Inc., apparel store Lululemon Athletica Inc. and restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Such diversity was similar during the past decade when biotechnology, industrial, energy, restaurant and medical equipment providers also led the market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Ordinary investors, many of whom own exchange-traded funds, will continue to benefit from their familiar and substantial holdings of Tesla and the five tech giants. As ETFs increase their investment in the stay-at-home group of firms, the seemingly narrow rally will become broader.The American stock market in the second quarter also bore no resemblance to its counterparts around the world, especially among the developed countries in Asia and Europe that have had more success containing Covid-19. As a result, the best-performing companies in the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index reflect the expectation that a return to business as usual is coming soon, and they include health-care suppliers, tourism, shipbuilding, technology and bicycle manufacturing. Similarly, the top 10 stocks in Europe include insurance firms, industrial companies and jewelry stores in addition to technology.For the first time, the U.S. stock market has gone its own way, led by investors who believe the coronavirus is here to stay.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Matthew Winkler, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Bloomberg News, writes about markets.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinionSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-07-15 09:52:43,Tesla Wins Tax Breaks For Potential Vehicle Factory In Texas,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc. (TSLA) will be granted millions of dollars in tax subsidies from a central Texas county that includes Austin, if it builds a $1.1 billion vehicle factory in the area.Shares rose 2.2% to $1,550.02 in Wednesday’s pre-market trading after a majority of commissioners in Travis County voted in favor of providing the electric carmaker with a tax rebate worth at least $14.7 million dependent on meeting certain milestones, Reuters reported.The decision to approve the tax breaks marks a step forward for Texas as it vies with Oklahoma to attract a new factory to build Tesla’s Y sport utility vehicles and cybertrucks.The electric carmaker has only one vehicle manufacturing plant in California and has been seeking to start building a large second plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year.Tesla has demanded Travis County for an 80% rebate on its property taxes for 10 years, worth $14.7 million, as well as a 65% rebate for the next 10 years after that. The electric carmaker said the factory would create 5,000 jobs, mostly low-skilled.Shares of the electric carmaker have jumped a stellar 262% this year with the majority of Wall Street analysts staying sidelined on the stock with a Hold analyst consensus.Barclays analyst Brian Johnson who has a Hold rating on Tesla with a $300 price target (80% downside potential) believes the stock is overvalued and has more room to run, and therefore recommends ""bearish friends to remain in the shelter of their caves"".Commenting on Tesla’s recent car deliveries report, Johnson said that the carmaker “beat a low bar for deliveries (90.6k actual, vs. 70k consensus, we were at 85k), leading to a massive two-day run in the shares.”“We were above consensus on earnings going into deliveries with the additional 5k deliveries we now forecast $42.0mn GAAP profit – enough to qualify for S&P; 500 inclusion,” Johnson wrote in a note to investors. “As a result, while we still believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued, we see nothing to prevent the shares moving higher in the coming weeks.”In light of the share’s rally this year, it is not surprising that the $905.50 average analyst price target now implies 40% downside potential to current levels.

The company is looking for the perfect place to build a new factory to manufacture the futuristic pickup, and it has approved for huge tax breaks in Travis County, Texas, according to CNBC.After having the Fremont factory shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Elon Musk went on a rant, complaining of the factory's location. He then talked about new factory locations, specifically in Texas. This lead to the hunt for a new factory, with benefits, to build the Cybertruck.See Also: Elon Musk To Bring Tesla Cybertruck On Cross-Country DriveThe spot where Tesla would build the factory is known as the Austin Green development. Tesla still has to actually purchase the land, but now the company knows the benefits of building in Travis County, and other spots in the country that want Tesla's factory can decide what offers they would like to give.Benzinga's Take: While the initial reaction to the Cybertruck was mixed, it seems Tesla could have a hit on their hands. These tax benefits will help Tesla build its factory, but also ultimately benefit the citizens and county by bringing jobs and infrastructure. Tulsa, Oklahoma is also in the running for a potential spot for a future Cybertruck factory.See more from Benzinga  * Tesla Sentry Mode Records Car Thieves, Helps Find Stolen Porsche  * German Court Says Tesla's 'Autopilot,' 'Full Self Driving' Ads Misleading  * Tesla China May Be Increasing Hiring, Possibly In Preparation For Made In China Model Y(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-15 13:05:49,Online Shareholder Meetings Are Packing In the Virtual Crowds,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The Zoom Boom is coming to a shareholder meeting near you.Investors are flocking to virtual shareholder meetings as the coronavirus leads companies to gather online. Amazon.com Inc., for example, drew more than 1,000 participants to its online-only affair in May. Fewer than 150 on average attended in person in previous years, a company spokeswoman said.The change is shaking up annual meetings at a time when stockholders are demanding more transparency. As issues such as employee diversity take center stage, online gatherings can bolster participation -- providing tech glitches don’t get in the way -- but at the expense of getting to grill management face-to-face.Increased attendance “may make it easier to get things through that otherwise might get held up,” said David Yermack, a professor at New York University.Going virtual started gaining traction after 2009 when Intel Corp. held the first online annual meeting, according to a Harvard Law School paper.With social distancing measures in place this year, companies such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. held virtual-only assemblies for the first time.About 65% of S&P; 500 index companies had hosted virtual meetings or said they would as of May 1, according to Intelligize Inc., a research platform for compliance professionals. Only 11% of them had held their meetings online before and almost all of the companies that went virtual cited Covid-19 as the reason.Financial technology firm Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. said it has hosted more than 1,300 online shareholder meetings this year through mid-June. That’s more than six times the number held in the year-earlier period.Yermack and Lily Li, an assistant professor at Temple University, estimate that this year 70% of the annual meetings in the U.S. will be virtual, compared to 7% in 2019.Shareholder advocates say technical snafus and the lack of in-person engagement with executives pose challenges. Online meetings may allow companies to cherry pick audience questions and executives to give more scripted answers.“If you’re in a room with people, you can sort of see what’s going on, and if there’s a shareholder who wants to ask a question and is not being called on, it’s sort of obvious,” said Ken Bertsch, a special adviser at the Council of Institutional Investors. “But you can’t tell that in a virtual meeting.”In some cases, investors who sought to attend virtually encountered difficulty proving they were shareholders, according to CII.Going virtual may be short lived. Home Depot Inc. and ConocoPhillips, which held their annual meetings online this year, have said they expect to revert in 2021.Yet hold-outs remain. Among them: Tesla Inc., which plans to have its annual meeting in September at its factory in Fremont, California, provided health guidelines allow. In a nod to tech, Tesla will webcast the event.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The factory is surrounded by trees, which is a good look after the controversy Tesla faced cutting down trees to make room.

2020-07-15 16:50:56,Tesla Shares Take a Breather After Historic Run,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- After a torrid rally that saw shares more than double since early May, Tesla Inc. is taking a pause on Wednesday, even as the broader market rises on the hopes for a coronavirus vaccine.Tesla shares dropped as much as 3.9% to $1,457 in New York on Wednesday, as the S&P; 500 Index rose as much as 1.3%. The electric vehicle maker is now worth in excess of $275 billion, having increased by more than the equivalent of Caterpiller Inc.’s entire market value in just this month.“The question becomes, where do the positive deltas come from now?” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. Investors expect more good news in the near future, including an entry into the Indian market, announcement of an electric mini-car and a possible inclusion into the S&P; 500 Index. But the current valuation already takes that into account. It is “hard to come up with something that drives it much higher right now,” Irwin added.The optimism around Tesla had also lifted the stocks of other smaller electric vehicle companies, such as Nio Inc., Workhorse Group Inc., Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp. and Nikola Corp., all of which were down on Wednesday, with the exception of Nikola. The share price of these companies have risen at least three-fold over the past three months, with Workhorse jumping 674%.“There is a risk-off trade happening in Tesla heading into earnings next week with profitability a lingering question,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, adding that the stock has had a “performance for the history books, the bulls are hedging their bets.”While Tesla’s second-quarter delivery numbers impressed analysts, even the optimists have found themselves hard-pressed to explain the explosive rise in the share price.“We have made efforts to identify the source of such extraordinary levels of volume, but admittedly, it is not entirely clear to us where the bulk of the volume is originating,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note on Tuesday. “One client said there appears to be ‘bigger forces at work’ in this market and for a variety of reasons the Tesla equity instrument has been anointed the ‘chosen one.’”(Updates share move, adds Roth comment in third paragraph, other stocks in fourth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-07-15 17:40:02,Tesla Ticker Confusion May Be Aiding Biotech Stock’s Rally,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- A dual-listed British biotechnology firm with a U.S. ticker that could be mistaken for Tesla Inc. has more than tripled in New York trading this year.Tiziana Life Sciences Plc has drawn increased interest from retail investors amid the electric automaker’s meteoric rise, as seen by the jump in Robinhood accounts holding American depositary receipts of the drug developer, according to Robintrack.net. Tiziana’s ADRs trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker “TLSA,” and even some media publications have at times mistaken them for Tesla shares, which trade under “TSLA.”H.C. Wainwright analyst Raghuram Selvaraju said it’s possible day traders are accidentally “buying shares of Tiziana when they intended to buy shares of Tesla,” though he sees several reasons the biotech stock is worth owning. Among those are a planned spinoff of its diagnostic tool for predicting breast cancer, which will be discussed at Tiziana’s annual meeting on Thursday. The London-based company is also developing a drug for Covid-19.Tiziana’s ADRs touched an intraday record of $10 each Wednesday, as the company announced a change to the ratio of ADRs per ordinary shares, effective July 31. In London trading, Tiziana shares -- ticker: TILS LN -- have soared 283% year-to-date.Selvaraju, the sole analyst tracked by Bloomberg who covers the ADRs, has a buy rating and $25 price target, more than 160% above the current price.An outside spokesman for Tiziana didn’t immediately return voice-mail or email messages seeking comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

An expansion at the Fremont factory was recently reported, and this shutdown will most likely make that expansion operation.This isn't the first time the Fremont factory has shut down for upgrades. A similar shutdown was seen during the Model 3 ramp-up, while Tesla struggled to produce enough cars to meet demand. This shutdown comes at a good time, as California sees surging cases of COVID-19, Tesla may be forced to close the factory once again.Why It's Important: During the last pandemic induced shutdown, Tesla used the time to make upgrades to manufacturing lines. Tesla must use its time wisely, as Fremont is only one of two factories producing Tesla's vehicles worldwide.Earlier today, Elon Musk shared a render of the next Gigafactory being constructed in Berlin, which is expected to produce Model Y and eventually Model 3.Benzinga's Take: This is great news for Tesla. It shows they are ready to increase production of the popular Model Y, and sell even more vehicles. Tesla recently reduced the price of the Model Y, which should improve demand.As Tesla builds more factories across the globe, including a potential Cybertruck factory in Texas, these planned factory upgrades will not slow the company as much as they may today.Photo courtesy of Tesla.See more from Benzinga  * Elon Musk Posts Impressive Photo Render Of Gigafactory Berlin  * Tesla Gets .1B Tax Break Approval From Travis County, Texas  * Tesla Sentry Mode Records Car Thieves, Helps Find Stolen Porsche(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-16 01:16:34,Twitter Hackers Divert Bitcoin Spoils to Other Accounts,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- A security incident involving some of the most prominent business and political leaders on Twitter duped people into sending at least $120,000 worth of Bitcoin to an anonymous online wallet, and more than half of that total has already been spirited to other accounts, according to a Bitcoin-tracing company.The person or people behind the scam gained access to the Twitter accounts of executives including Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc. Founder Elon Musk, asking users to direct Bitcoin to one of three different accounts, said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, which has helped law-enforcement agencies track Bitcoin-related crime. About $65,000 of the $120,000 collected from duped users has moved to other Bitcoin addresses, one of which has been active in the past and is registered with a U.S. exchange, Robinson said.That money trail could prove useful to investigators in this case, since U.S. exchanges typically go through vigorous verification of user identities, and would probably have information on which name the account is registered under.About half of the funds the hackers acquired came from users in the U.S., a quarter from Europe and the remainder from Asia, Robinson said.Read more: Twitter Hack Snags Obama, Biden, Gates Accounts in Bitcoin ScamDiscovering the perpetrators could still take time and prove challenging.“It depends on what they do next, it depends on how they try to cash out,” Robinson said. If they try to use a regulated exchange in the U.S., finding them will be easy. But if they try to cash out through one of the hundreds of small, unregulated exchanges, that could be harder, he said.“They are obviously sophisticated in that they didn’t send these funds directly to an exchange to cash out,” Robinson said.While Bitcoin is supposed to be difficult to track, a number of tracing firms have sprung up to help law enforcement. Exchanges and other providers have begun collecting more information on their customers. So law-enforcement agencies have been able to track stolen Bitcoins many times in the past.Aside from prominent political and business leaders, the attacks also affected many crypto companies like the Gemini exchange. The accounts promised to double the amount of money sent to their Bitcoin address.Coinbase Inc., the largest U.S. crypto exchange, has begun blocking its users’ payments sent to the hackers’ accounts. “We are essentially blacklisting addresses as we see them posted in the scam tweets,” said Elliott Suthers, a spokesman for Coinbase.Gemini also blocked the attackers’ accounts, according to a Gemini spokesperson.Already, as news of the scheme began making headlines, the rate of payments sent to the scam address has slowed down, Robinson said.“I don’t think they’ll be able to raise much more, to be honest,” he said.Bitcoin is an attractive target for scammers because it can be used worldwide. While Bitcoin’s price dropped at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has since recovered, and is up roughly 30% since the beginning of the year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-07-16 03:41:39,Crypto Hack Latest in a History of High-Profile Twitter Breaches,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of the highest-profile Twitter accounts, including former President Barack Obama and Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, were subject to a breathtaking hack on Wednesday involving a Bitcoin-related scam. Twitter Inc. temporarily blocked all verified accounts from posting or even changing their passwords while it investigated and sought to resolve the issue.The scale of the hack was unprecedented, but Twitter has had significant security problems before. Here are a few of the most prominent recent attacks.January 2020: NFL teams hackedEarlier this year, more than a dozen Twitter accounts for teams in the National Football League were hijacked just a week before the Super Bowl. The Green Bay Packers official account tweeted, “We are here to Show people that everything is hackable.” The posts were later claimed by the group OurMine. Twitter said the accounts were hacked through a third-party platform.August 2019: CEO sends offensive tweetsTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey‘s account, followed by more than 4 million people, fired off a slew of vulgar and racist tweets that were taken down about 20 minutes later. The cause, according to a Twitter spokesman: “The phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider.” A group calling itself Chuckling Squad took responsibility.November 2018: Twitter support forms exploitedTwitter said it identified an issue with one of its support forms that could expose the country code of a user’s associated phone number. It received a large number of inquiries via the affected form from individual IP addresses in China and Saudi Arabia, saying they could have had ties to state-sponsored actors.July 2016: Dorsey hacked by OurMineIt was clear something was wrong when Dorsey’s account tweeted out: “testing your security,” a hack that apparently came from OurMine. Within an hour, Twitter deleted the tweets, according to reports at the time.June 2016: 32 million passwords for saleHackers appeared to have used malware to collect more than 32 million Twitter passwords, and put them up for sale on the dark web, according to TechCrunch. Twitter said that its own systems had not been breached.January 2015: U.S. military account tweets ISIS messagesThe U.S. military’s Central Command tweeted out threatening messages and changed its header message to include the text “i love you isis.” The Washington Post said the military was treating it as an act of “cybervandalism” and responded by immediately taking its social media accounts offline.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-07-16 03:44:38,Carson Block Warns Tesla Short Sellers: ‘I Wouldn’t Do That’,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Carson Block and Elon Musk can agree on at least one thing: betting against Tesla Inc.’s stock is a bad idea.Block, the longtime Musk critic and short-selling founder of Muddy Waters Capital LLC, said on Wednesday that he doesn’t have any bearish wagers against Tesla even though he thinks the business is unsustainable.“I’m not short the stock, thank God,” Block said in an interview with Bloomberg’s Tracy Alloway and Joe Weisenthal on the Odd Lots podcast. “We used to joke that Tesla, when it files for bankruptcy, will probably have a $30 billion market cap. Short it at your own risk. I wouldn’t do that.”Tesla’s more than 300% surge since mid-March has captivated bulls while baffling skeptics who say the electric vehicle maker is grossly overpriced. Even as individual investors buy at a frenzied pace, the value of wagers against the stock has swelled to nearly $20 billion. It now trades at 182 times estimated 12-month earnings, versus 10 times for General Motors Co.Block said at one point he had a Tesla position that involved buying the company’s convertible bonds and using the coupon payments to fund long-dated put options on the stock, but he eventually sold the debt and let the puts expire.“It’s one thing to bet on Elon Musk, but it’s another thing to bet against him,” Block said. “The guy specializes in pulling rabbits out of the hat.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-07-16 04:00:00,VW Executive Purge Stokes Unease Among Investors Envying Tesla,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, two knocks against Tesla Inc. were that a constant churn of executive turnover would catch up to Elon Musk, and that an onslaught of electric models from Volkswagen AG and others would put him in his place.Now, the tables have turned.VW’s electric offensive has sputtered, with software issues plaguing its battery-powered ID.3. And it’s the German giant whose executive suites are turning over: in a matter of days, its trucks chief resigned, the leader of its van unit was demoted and its head of software was reassigned.Even Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess’s job looked insecure for a moment before VW’s supervisory board settled on stripping him of responsibility for the company’s namesake division.The circumstances of each individual’s cases vary, and VW continues to have a massive leg up on Tesla in many respects. But some investors are concerned it might not be coincidence that all four VW executives in question were external hires installed to push through deep changes at the parochial carmaker. Their struggles of late cast a pall over the structural and cultural changes VW vowed to make after its diesel-emissions scandal a half decade ago.“VW risks being perceived as a large, slow-moving entity that is resistant to change in an industry where the pace of change is accelerating,” said Timm Schulze-Melander, an industrials specialist at the equity-research firm Redburn. “How will such a group manage to attract and retain the software engineering skills that may prove be so critical to its future?”The coronavirus pandemic is now posing the biggest challenge to VW since the diesel crisis erupted, while Tesla’s potential to maintain an electric-car edge has powered its stock surge. At $286.8 billion as of Tuesday’s close, the Elon Musk-led company’s market capitalization has soared past the $220 billion mark that VW’s top brass set as a goal last year.While VW is expected to report nine times as much revenue as Tesla this year, investors value the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company at a little more than a third of its target. It’s still the third-biggest carmaker by market capitalization and better positioned to weather the industry’s seismic technology shift than many of its peers.Diess, 61, spent almost two decades rising up the ranks of BMW AG before VW poached him in 2015 to revive weak profit margins at its core brand. He became CEO of the group two years ago. But at an extraordinary supervisory board meeting on June 8, key stakeholders forced him to cede direct control of the VW passenger-car unit and focus on leading the group.Diess was stripped of the role after a series of troubling signals about his job status. First, VW’s powerful labor leaders blamed him for struggles to adopt stricter emission-tests procedures in Europe, which caused major production disruptions. Then, technical issues plagued early output of the critical Golf hatchback and new ID.3. A report that VW’s top supervisory board committee denied his request for an early contract extension further escalated tensions.At the beginning of June, Diess accused board members of committing crimes by leaking confidential discussions, according to people familiar with the matter. While he weathered the spat with the CEO job intact, the board issued an unusual public statement, saying it had accepted Diess’s apology and would continue to support him.The dust-up was only the beginning. On July 8, Traton SE, the VW truck unit that pushed through an underwhelming IPO last year after much internal wrangling, announced the abrupt departure of CEO Andreas Renschler and two other board members. The former Daimler AG veteran had been bridging divides between the rivalrous Scania and MAN brands and forging a joint global expansion strategy.The surprise move raised questions about the prospects for MAN’s latest restructuring plan. Nord/LB analyst Frank Schwope summed up the announcement as a “bombshell.”Another senior executive, Thomas Sedran, was reassigned to handle asset management at VW’s commercial vehicles and machinery operations. The 2015 hire who previously worked for Opel had been head of VW’s light-commercial vehicles division and a key figure behind the company’s alliance with Ford Motor Co.VW didn’t offer a reason for the job change. Contracts to widen cooperation with Ford to self-driving car technology were just signed in May, and he was in the early stages of executing a plan negotiated with labor unions to restructure VW’s van business.The latest shake-up involves one of Diess’s top priorities. He wanted to establish a powerful in-house software unit that would supply all of the group’s 12 brands and ensure full control over the enormous amounts of data generated by connected cars -- a space Tesla has dominated.The issues VW has had with integrating “baby-step” software into the Golf and ID.3 shows just how much work has to be done to boost the company’s competency in this area, said Chris McNally, Evercore ISI’s auto analyst.Less than a month after the group-wide operation dubbed Car.Software.Org started, Audi CEO Markus Duesmann is taking charge, replacing IT chief Christian Senger. VW said Wednesday it’s examining what his next job will be.VW can ill-afford to waste time with infighting. Musk, who remains unpredictable as ever, isn’t waiting to have his plant near Berlin built to start hyping its capabilities. He’s also hinted at adding a European-style hatchback to Tesla’s lineup, which would target VW’s core car business.“Gigafactory is the product even more than the car,” he wrote Wednesday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Tesla revealed earlier this month it delivered 90,650 vehicles in the second quarter this year. The disclosure by the Palo Alto-based automaker indicates that it had restored production to levels as they existed before the shutdown.Price Action On Wednesday, Tesla shares traded 2.26% lower at $1,511 in the after-hours. The shares had closed the regular session 1.93% higher at $1,546.01.See more from Benzinga  * Tesla To Debut In India By 2021, Expects Roth Capital's Irwin, Raises Price Target  * Tesla Share Frenzy Means Elon Musk May Enjoy .8B Personal Windfall  * Tesla Website Crashes As Musk Puts 'Short Shorts' On Sale(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-07-16 10:00:11,"Instead of Criticizing Tech Valuations, Embrace Them",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Covid-19 pandemic may have hurt the economy, but for technology stocks it feels like 1999 again. The Nasdaq Composite Index just reached a record high having rebounded about 50% from its low of the year in March. The stock market is not the economy, but it does feels strange for stocks to be soaring in the middle of a deep recession.The difference is timescale: stock prices represent revenue and earnings very far out into the future, not today. If plans for new technology are sound, the outlook can still look bright even though the present seems gloomy. The rationale for sky-high valuations for tech stocks in the late 1990s also came from projected profits in the decades to come. These so-called concept stocks won investors through a compelling story about future potential, even though the company in the near term would generate little-to-nothing in terms of real revenue.Maybe concept stocks were a crazy phenomenon from a more exuberant time, such as Beanie Babies or jelly shoes. But take Tesla Inc. True fans are buying the stock because they believe in a vision of a technologically advanced electric car and other products, while grouchy short-sellers write long, critical blog posts about the company’s weak balance sheet and high debt. Is it better to price the stock on the concept, or on the fundamentals alone? Neither seems like the perfectly accurate way to value the company.Valuations that are too high can lead to vaporware and waste, but a valuation that is too low can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. In other words, if Tesla were valued only on its balance sheet, the company might not be able to raise enough cash to keep building and developing electric cars. It seems a fairly safe bet that Tesla is innovative enough to keep coming up with new inventions, above and beyond their existing revenue lines, but when new products are involved, the expected future profit and revenue over the long term is difficult to predict.Many people would put a high probability on Apple Inc. coming out with a new product, such as virtual reality glasses, but the company’s shares were trading at around a relatively paltry 20 times earnings through much of 2019, which amounted to not much more than future iPhone revenue. Although the ratio has moved up to about 30, that still seems low for a company like Apple and may be a sign investors are shifting away from valuing it just on iPhone revenue. Experienced venture capitalists are happy to take the risk on hypothetical products for early-stage startups, but the stock market hasn’t figured out how to “price in” products that are yet to be created by established public companies.It’s often said that tech companies “ship their org chart,” meaning that the products they create can be directly predicted by the structure of the organization. By looking at the people and incentives, an outside observer should be able to estimate the impact, quality and probability of success of a new product, and perhaps even future revenue. If Apple had hired a world-class team of chip engineers who had all taken a pay cut to work on a cutting edge project, we might expect its share price to rise on the news, though without a better valuation method, we can't yet say precisely by how much.Economist Stian Westlake used the phrase “intangible capital” to describe the benefits a company derives from its people and organizational structure. If we could use an org chart to accurately price intangible assets, it might be easier to value a company for not only its past products, but expected future products as well.To be sure, the difficulty of pricing in new product lines does exist in the realm of private companies. Softbank Group Corp’s Vision Fund made big and bold bets in promising companies, valuing them above what their revenue might suggest. But some of these companies were not able to meet their targets, collapsing under the weight of too much capital. For growing tech unicorns, valued in the $1 billion to $50 billion range, it is certainly difficult to raise money for a new product line based on intangible assets. Capital should be flowing into these highly innovative, cutting-edge companies in the current low-interest rate world, but few understand how to structure the appropriate financing.With an economy in trouble, the path back to prosperity depends on tech companies rapidly scaling up, generating revenue and creating jobs. Finer-tuned pricing of intangible assets could speed up the recovery process, allowing growing tech companies to raise money for new product lines, rather than just to scale up old ones. It could also help them to acquire old economy companies in leveraged deals financed around symbiotic revenue benefits.In some ways, intangible capital is reminiscent of the nascent days of high-yield bonds in the 1980s, in that an accurate formula could change the world. Price it correctly, and you would be able to leverage small amounts of capital to totally reshape the economy instead of promoting breakups and hostile takeovers. So instead of criticizing high stock prices for tech companies, embrace and understand them for they may be the key to the economic recovery. The race is on to figure out the winning formula.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Saku Panditharatne is a consultant for the technology industry.

2020-07-16 11:38:04,Tesla Car Registrations In California Sink 48% in Q2 – Report,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc.’s (TSLA) vehicle registrations in California almost halved in the second quarter of the year, Reuters reported, citing data from Cross-Sell, a marketing research firm that collates title and registration data.Shares were trading down 5.4% at $1,463 in Thursday’s pre-market trading. The data showed registrations in California, a bellwether market for the electric-car maker, plunged almost 48% from a year earlier to 9,774 vehicles in the three months ended June 2020.During the reported period between April and June, most parts of the U.S. were under government-imposed stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, which impacted production and caused a plunge in auto sales.Tesla’s only U.S. vehicle factory in California was closed for more than six weeks with production disrupted from the end of March to early May.In the second quarter, Model 3 registrations in the state, which accounted for more than half of the total registrations, dropped 63.6% to 5,951 vehicles. Total vehicle registrations in the 23 states from where the data was collected fell nearly 49% to 18,702 vehicles. Registration figures might not accurately reflect the number of vehicle deliveries during the quarter as registrations in the U.S. typically take about 30 days from the time of sale.Tesla stock has this month already gained 43% as the carmaker reported 90,650 car deliveries in the second quarter, which exceeded analysts’ expectations for about 74,130 vehicles.Barclays analyst Brian Johnson who has a Hold rating on Tesla with a $300 price target (81% downside potential) believes the stock is overvalued but has more room to run, and therefore recommends ""bearish friends to remain in the shelter of their caves"".Commenting on Tesla’s second-quarter car deliveries report, Johnson said that the carmaker “beat a low bar for deliveries (90.6k actual, vs. 70k consensus, we were at 85k), leading to a massive two-day run in the shares.”“We were above consensus on earnings going into deliveries with the additional 5k deliveries we now forecast $42.0mn GAAP profit – enough to qualify for S&P; 500 inclusion,” Johnson wrote in a note to investors. “As a result, while we still believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued, we see nothing to prevent the shares moving higher in the coming weeks.”Looking ahead, five-star analyst Daniel Ives at Wedbush says that although investors will be focusing next on 2Q earnings on July 22, he continues to believe that Battery Day now to be held on Sept. 22 will be a major positive catalyst for the stock.The analyst though maintained a Hold rating on the stock with a $1,250 price target for the base case and a $2,000 price target for the bull case. In line with Johnson's and Ives’ rating outlook, the majority of Wall Street analysts are sidelined on the stock with a Hold analyst consensus.In light of this year’s strong rally, the $905.50 average analyst price target now implies 41% downside potential for the shares in the coming 12 months.

2020-07-16 12:00:00,"Wanted: Start-Ups That Can Turn Captured CO2 Into Vodka, Jewels",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Vodka and diamonds are being enlisted in the fight against climate change.With a little ingenuity, both can be made by manipulating carbon dioxide that’s been captured from the air, which means their production could actually help stem global warming. The market for such products is promising enough that a group of clean-tech incubators is on the hunt for start-ups that can create them.New York University’s Urban Future Lab is working with Greentown Labs and Fraunhofer USA to help grow businesses that have figured out how to turn CO2 into luxury goods and more. The group’s “Carbon to Value Initiative” offers start-ups a home for initial development, access to venture capital, and manufacturing partners.“We mean to jump-start the carbon technology industry,” said Pat Sapinsley, managing director of cleantech initiatives at Urban Future Lab. “We’ll use our corporate partners to scale-up quickly. It’s necessary to stay below a 2-degree Celsius increase,” she said, referring to the warming limit widely believed to be necessary to prevent catastrophic climate impacts.Technology to produce goods from CO2 has been around for a while, but the products themselves have gained little traction because they’re more expensive than similar ones manufactured in traditional ways. The incubator group is hoping to change that by focusing on high-value items -- consumers may be willing to pay a premium for luxury goods that combat climate change.Luxury GoodsThe vodka producer, Air Co., joined Sapinsley’s group last year. The company aims to replicate Elon Musk’s strategy with Tesla Inc., by selling a premium product that will help build scale so they can get to larger markets like jet fuel.“They use renewable energy to split water to make hydrogen and combine that with CO2 to make ethanol and sell it for $65 a liter,” Sapinsley said. By expanding capacity on sales of pricey liquor, they can bring the costs down to compete against a 40-cent jet fuel. “You need to have high-value products, even diamonds, that will lead to success of carbon conversion.”Combined, the incubators have helped hundreds of startups improve clean technologies and raise funds to expand, and they expect to get hundreds of applications for promising new carbontech products and services during this three-year effort.“There is an urgency to cost-effectively capture carbon emissions and the only way for the new technology we need to get to market is through engagement with industry,” said Emily Reichert, chief executive officer of Greentown Labs. “We help them de-risk it to reduce cost and get it to scale.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-16 14:37:39,"Markets Were Spared From Twitter Hack, But It’s Still a Big Risk",TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- This time it was just a cryptocurrency scam. But what happens if hackers infiltrate Twitter again and take aim at financial markets?It’s easy to imagine a scenario where, instead of tweeting about Bitcoin, a hacked Elon Musk account plunges Tesla Inc.’s stock into a tailspin. It would only take a few seconds for a rogue @realDonaldTrump to send financial shockwaves around the world.For investors who rely on platforms like Twitter to navigate markets, Wednesday’s cyber attack on the accounts of prominent U.S. business and political leaders is a reminder that no source of information is infallible. It also highlights the myriad risks posed by hackers in an era when decisions about trading, and much else, are increasingly made by hyper-fast computers instead of humans.“It definitely exposes the vulnerability of our own credentials and processes,” Deven Choksey, a strategist at KRChoksey Investment Managers Pvt in Mumbai. “A false or mischievous communication can pose a very big and serious threat to the entire financial system.”The hack took place just after 4 p.m. New York time on Wednesday, after U.S. markets closed and before the Asia open. Within a short span of time, the Twitter accounts of high-profile figures such as Bill Gates and Kayne West, along with companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Apple Inc., were urging followers to send funds via Bitcoin.Twitter Hack Hits Obama, Biden, Musk in Bitcoin ScamTwitter said it had detected “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools” and has started an investigation into the incident.Many of the details behind the attack and what other information the criminals could have accessed are still unknown. For now, the hack doesn’t seem to have affected markets, but the potential for chaos and confusion from similar events remains.“As a trader of equities, commodities, or fixed income, one would be remiss in not having some automatic Twitter feed,” said Tom di Galoma, director of government trading and strategy at Seaport Global Holdings in New York. “However given the recent news, I would have to say traders will have second thoughts on the validity of the news.”In 2013, hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts of the Associated Press and falsely reported that there were explosions at the White House and that President Barack Obama was injured. In about two minutes, about $136 billion was wiped from the S&P; 500 Index.Back then, fewer executives and politicians used Twitter and computerized trading wasn’t nearly as sophisticated. It all means that there’s the potential for a future attack to have a far greater impact, especially if it’s credible-seeming news coming from influential accounts.No one has swayed financial markets through Twitter as much as U.S. President Donald Trump, who regularly gives updates on everything from Chinese trade to energy policy on the platform. In April, Trump sparked a surge in oil prices of more than 30% by announcing that Saudi Arabia and Russia would make major output cuts.Musk has also relied on Twitter for market-moving announcements. He shocked investors in 2018 and sparked a brief rally in Tesla shares when he tweeted about taking it private at $420. (Many people assumed his feed was hacked -- it hadn’t been.) Three weeks later, he backtracked and said the company would remain public.Retail investors, who have access to fewer sources of real-time information and often rely on social media for trading tips, are among the investors most at risk for being conned, according to Viraj Patel, a currency and macro strategist at Arkera Inc. in London.“Retail traders now have a huge influence on stock markets, potentially just reading a headline and acting quite quickly,” he said. “That is worrying.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

The new strategy was planned before a massive hacking incident upended the platform on Wednesday.The social-media company has long offered three versions of its API, or application programming interface, which allows outside developers to access large numbers of public tweets for activities such as research and customer service. Twitter plans to create more free and paid versions of those offerings as a way to entice more customers to use them, including a special set of APIs specifically for researchers, the company said Thursday in a statement.An updated version of the “standard” API, which is free for all developers, was supposed to launch Thursday with new data from some of Twitter’s features, like poll results and threaded conversations. But the company delayed the rollout until next week after Wednesday’s security breach in which hackers took over many of the service’s most popular accounts, including those of former President Barack Obama and Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, in a scam to gain Bitcoin.The company shut down verified accounts across the system Wednesday as it investigated the breach, which Twitter said targeted employees with access to the platform’s internal controls, letting the hackers take control of the high-profile accounts.“While we have no evidence the incident had anything to do with our API, turning it on (Thursday) took a back seat to making sure the people who use Twitter are safe and secure,” a spokeswoman said in an email late Wednesday.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-16 18:55:59,Twitter Hackers Shifting Money in Bitcoin Wallets Leave Trail,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Whoever is behind the security incident involving some of the most prominent business and political leaders on Twitter -- a scam that raised about $120,000 worth of Bitcoin -- is shifting the spoils around online accounts, creating the beginnings of a digital paper trail that investigators are scouring for clues.Hackers gained access to the Twitter accounts of executives including Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos and Tesla Inc. Founder Elon Musk, asking users to direct Bitcoin to one of three different accounts, said Tom Robinson, co-founder of Elliptic, which helps law-enforcement agencies track Bitcoin-related crime.Bitcoin offers users a degree of anonymity, making it a popular vehicle for criminal behavior. But investigators can glean valuable information in cases where the cryptocurrency is moved to accounts, or wallets, that have carried out transactions with certain U.S. exchanges or services. That’s because U.S. exchanges typically take pains to verify user identity.“Sharing this information fast with the authorities worldwide and with companies from the ecosystem, will help us stop the stolen funds and find more info about the attackers,” said Itsik Levy, co-founder of Whitestream, a Bitcoin researcher.The attackers received just over 400 payments, valued at $121,000, according to Elliptic. The largest payment came from a Japan-based exchange, and totaled about $42,000.Soon after they were initially collected in the three accounts, the funds started moving around. About $65,000 of the $120,000 quickly moved to other Bitcoin addresses, one of which has been active in the past and has transacted with a U.S. exchange, Robinson said.Of the amount moved, about $60,000 was directed to a Bitcoin address that has been active since May, Whitestream said. That address had interacted with Coinbase Inc., the largest U.S. crypto exchange, as well as payment processors BitPay and CoinPayments, Whitestream said. Coinbase declined to comment. BitPay and CoinPayments didn’t immediately return requests for comment.The money that was initially collected in three Bitcoin addresses has now been moved to 12 new addresses, according to Elliptic.The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory Thursday saying crypto exchanges and other financial institutions should report any suspicious activities related to the hack as soon as possible. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the New York Department of Financial Services will investigate the incident, and, according to Reuters, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is also on the case.Read more: Twitter Hack Snags Obama, Biden, Gates Accounts in Bitcoin ScamDiscovering the perpetrators could still take time and prove challenging.“It depends on what they do next, it depends on how they try to cash out,” Robinson said. If they try to use a regulated exchange in the U.S., finding them will be easy. But if they try to cash out through one of the hundreds of small, unregulated exchanges, that could be harder, he said.“They are obviously sophisticated in that they didn’t send these funds directly to an exchange to cash out,” Robinson said.About a quarter of the funds the hackers acquired came from accounts tied to North America, and more than 50% from accounts in Asia, according to Elliptic.While Bitcoin is supposed to be difficult to track, a number of tracing firms have sprung up to help law enforcement. Exchanges and other providers have begun collecting more information on their customers. So law-enforcement agencies have been able to track stolen Bitcoins many times in the past.Aside from prominent political and business leaders, the attacks also affected many crypto companies like the Gemini exchange. The hacked accounts promised to double the amount of money sent to their Bitcoin address.Coinbase has begun blocking its users’ payments sent to the hackers’ accounts. “We are essentially blacklisting addresses as we see them posted in the scam tweets,” said Elliott Suthers, a spokesman for Coinbase.Gemini also blocked the attackers’ accounts, according to a Gemini spokesperson.Another reason Bitcoin is an attractive target for scammers is that it can be used worldwide. While Bitcoin’s price dropped at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has since recovered, and is up roughly 30% since the beginning of the year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk. Those who gained access to the accounts used them to attempt a bitcoin scam, sending tweets asking for people to give them money in exchange for a bigger payment in return.Twitter said Wednesday evening that the hack was part of a “coordinated social engineering attack” that targeted Twitter employees. It granted hackers access to some of the company’s internal systems, and then high-profile user accounts, the company said. That forced Twitter to temporarily halt verified accounts from sending any tweets.Twitter said it would take “significant steps to limit access to internal systems and tools while our investigation is ongoing.” Twitter is still probing how the attack was carried out and has not disclosed if any other information related to the accounts, such as data like private messages, was compromised.U.S. politicians quickly called on Twitter to share more information. “The ability of bad actors to take over prominent accounts, even fleetingly, signals a worrisome vulnerability in this media environment,” said Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and one of the tech industry’s most vocal critics. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the hack.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-07-17 10:28:12,Daimler Must Wish It Had Kept That Tesla Stake,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tesla Inc.’s march to a $275 billion market capitalization has been pretty galling for Germany, the birthplace of the automobile. But the pain is felt most acutely at Daimler AG, which used to be a large Tesla shareholder.Had the owner of the luxury Mercedes-Benz brand kept hold of the almost 5 million shares it offloaded in 2014, they would now be worth about $7.3 billion by my calculation — a sum that’s equivalent to two-thirds of Daimler’s current net industrial cash position.(1)In the annals of ill-timed investment decisions, that stake sale doesn’t quite match the U.K.’s flogging off a big chunk of its gold reserves when prices bottomed out around the turn of the millennium. It still hurts, particularly at a time when industrial companies are counting every last cent.Fortunately there’s some good news to console Daimler’s long suffering shareholders. The company’s performance in the most recent quarter was a lot better than expected. Instead of burning a large amount of cash, Daimler’s industrial business recorded an almost 700 million-euro ($799 million) inflow during the three-month period. The quarterly operating loss of 1.7 billion euros was also a pretty respectable outcome, considering the pandemic forced the temporary closure of both factories and dealerships.The shares rose on Friday, extending the stock’s rally since its March low to almost 80%. While not Tesla-esque, that’s still pretty racy. Unfortunately, this resilient showing may make the task of restructuring Daimler that much harder.But first, what’s gone right? A recession would normally be devastating for auto sales. However, a pandemic changes the dynamic somewhat: Having a car is pretty helpful if you worry taking public transport might endanger your health.Mercedes’s car sales declined about a fifth in the first half of the year, but in June they were actually higher than the same month a year ago. The brand’s performance in China, where the pandemic seems to have been brought under control, was especially good. It helps too that the jobs of Mercedes’s customers – wealthy white collar workers – probably aren’t as threatened by the pandemic as other parts of the economy.That doesn’t mean Daimler is in the clear. The company’s margins had already deteriorated before the novel coronavirus appeared. Legal troubles involving dirty diesel engines contributed to a string of profit warnings, but the overarching problem was the massive cost of investing in cleaner propulsion technology, and that hasn’t gone away. At the same time, Daimler’s large production and staffing footprint in high-cost Germany and high level of vertical integration (it produces lots of parts itself rather than outsourcing the work) has become unsustainable.New Chief Executive Officer Ola Kallenius wants to trim the workforce by 15,000 positions, but the additional headwinds created by the pandemic may mean that number has to rise. Talks with trade unions have begun but unsurprisingly, they’re not going smoothly.The risk is that Daimler’s decent second-quarter performance lessens the urgency for change. Generating positive cash flow is also unhelpful from a political perspective: While Germany has boosted subsidies for low-cost electric vehicles and cut sales taxes, domestic carmakers have received remarkably little support from their government during this crisis.So Daimler still has plenty of work to do. It’s embarrassing that the world’s largest premium automaker and biggest truck maker is valued at barely 40 billion euros. Considering how Mercedes focuses on the premium end of the market, the car unit should be far more profitable than it is.Yes, Daimler should have moved faster to develop electric vehicles. But it’s not the dinosaur it’s sometimes characterized as. The EQS electric saloon set to go on sale in 2021 promises to cover more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) on a single charge, which might convince even the most range-anxious car buyers to abandon their addiction to combustion engines. The truck unit too is targeting a carbon-neutral fleet in key regions by 2039. In view of previous setbacks, Daimler’s shareholders will take more convincing before they believe in this recovery story and get over the disappointment of missing out on the Tesla rally. (1) Daimler acquired a 9% stake in Tesla in 2009 for the trifling sum of $50 million. The Germans quickly offloaded part of their stake, they got diluted when Tesla raised capital and sold the remaining 4% stake in 2014 for $780 million.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

Tesla shares have gained a stunning 259% in the year to date, while the S&P; 500  has fallen 0.5%, driven by ""euphoria' about electric vehicles, a run of promising datapoints and heightened interest from retail investors, who have become more active during the pandemic. Coming positive catalysts include Battery Day, when Tesla is expected to unveil a long-lasting battery for its future vehicles, and second-quarter earnings that may show a profit, said analysts Dan Levy and AJ Denham. The company is expected to reveal plans to expand capacity, and could double it from its current level of about 700,000 vehicles to 1.3 million, the analysts wrote. To justify its current share price, Tesla needs to clear a raised bar and show that by 2025, it will be producing 2.2 million cars, putting it on par with German car makers.

2020-07-23 00:05:30,Tesla makes $104M profit in 2Q despite factory shutdown,TSLA,https://www.ctpost.com,"DETROIT (AP) - Tesla overcame a seven-week pandemic-related shutdown at its California assembly plant to post a surprising $104 million net profit for the second quarter. 
 It was the electric car and solar panel maker's fourth-straight profitable quarter, qualifying it to be included in the S&P 500 index of corporate titans. That decision will be made later. 
 Local government restrictions forced Tesla to close its only U.S. assembly factory in Fremont, California, from March 23 to May 11. Even with no production, the company paid roughly 10,000 workers for part of the shutdown and Tesla continued health care and other benefits. 
 The profit, compared with a $408 million loss a year ago, pushed Tesla's shares up 5.7% to 1,682.99 in after-hours trading Wednesday. 
 But the company likely would have lost money without $428 million it earned from selling electric vehicle credits to other automakers so they can meet government fuel economy and pollution regulations. 
 Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said he expects money from the credits to double this year over the $594 million the company made in 2019, but said Tesla is not managing its business assuming that credits will contribute significantly in the future. The company is counting on manufacturing efficiencies to increase profits, he said. 
 Also Wednesday, Tesla said it has picked the Austin, Texas, area as the site for its second U.S. assembly plant. Austin was the front runner, but Tulsa, Oklahoma, was a possibility. 
 On a conference call with analysts and investors, CEO Elon Musk said that sometime in the future, Tesla will build a compact vehicle and a higher-capacity passenger vehicle, but he didn't give a time frame. He said Tesla is on its way to making vehicles more affordable through manufacturing..."

The company is constructing factories to produce both the Model Y and Cybertruck in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas.Although the construction on Gigafactory Texas only recently started, Tesla has added many job listings to its website for the unfinished factory. Some are related to construction, but others are for senior mechanical engineer and gallery leader, which is a sales support role.Benzinga's Take: Tesla's Gigafactory Texas is expected to be completed within one year if the build speed mirrors that of past projects like Gigafactory Shanghai.Tesla expects to build the Cybertruck here, and the company estimates the Cybertruck will be available by the end of 2021.

2020-08-12 17:30:04,Tesla Says Short Seller Is Funding Ex-Employee’s Lawsuit,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. says hedge fund Cable Car Capital LLC, which is shorting the company’s stock, is funding a former employee’s allegations that the company smeared him by accusing him of sabotage and stealing sensitive information.The carmaker said in a filing Monday that Martin Tripp’s 2018 counterclaim against Tesla was being funded by Cable Car, even though Tripp has said under oath that he had no financing or connection to Tesla short sellers.Tesla on Tuesday persuaded a judge to issue an emergency order forbidding Tripp from further publicizing confidential information. Tripp has disclosed volumes of Tesla’s confidential documents, deposition transcripts and filings in his posts on Twitter, YouTube and Google Drive, Tesla said in federal court in Reno, Nevada.“Tripp has no excuse,” Tesla said. “He is fully aware of his confidentiality obligations and is openly flouting them. And he has a ready source to pay any monetary sanctions, as his bogus defamation counterclaim against Tesla is being funded by a hedge fund, Cable Car Capital LLC, which is also a short seller of Tesla stock.”Cable Car portfolio manager Jacob Ma-Weaver, in a statement Wednesday, said it was “deeply disappointing” that Tripp “has chosen, against advice of counsel, to publicize confidential information including his funding arrangements.”Ma-Weaver said Funicular Fund LP, an investment partnership managed by Cable Car, provided “non-recourse financial support for Tripp’s defense and counterclaims,” but only “after learning of Tesla’s lawsuit in the media.” He said the litigation “is unrelated and immaterial to the fund’s investments in Tesla securities, which include short exposure and a long position in convertible debentures.”William Fischbach, one of Tripp’s lawyers, didn’t immediately respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment on Cable Car’s statement.Tesla has sued Tripp, a onetime technician at a Nevada factory, for allegedly stealing company trade secrets after he was denied a promotion. Tripp, in turn, filed his own suit accusing Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk of smearing him. Much of the fight has been waged through Twitter and strategic media leaks.According to Tesla, Tripp on Aug. 7 posted a link on Twitter to a public Google Drive folder that housed “voluminous” material related to the lawsuit, and he shared videos on YouTube discussing the case and Tesla secrets. The disclosures included confidential records produced by Tesla, transcripts and mediation documents.Tesla’s Phantom Shooter: The Strange Story of a Debunked ThreatTripp initially said he wouldn’t remove the information posted. On Aug. 8, he removed the link to the Google Drive folder, but by then the material had been shared and saved by others, Tesla said.“We’re obviously horrified and disappointed about what has happened,” Fischbach said Tuesday at a hearing by phone on Tesla’s emergency request.Tripp is parting ways with his lawyers and intends to represent himself, Fischbach said.U.S. Magistrate Judge Carla Baldwin ordered Tripp to stop disseminating and discussing confidential information from the lawsuit, including re-tweeting other people’s postings that contain the confidential documents. She also ordered Tripp to not contact Tesla’s lawyers directly as long as he’s still represented by his own attorneys.In addition, the judge scheduled a hearing on whether Tripp should be held in contempt of court for violating the order to keep information confidential and what sanctions he might face if so. Those sanctions could include dismissing his claim against Tesla and rendering a default judgment against him, Baldwin said.Shorting a stock is selling borrowed shares, buying them back once they’ve fallen and pocketing the difference.The case is Tesla Inc. v.

2020-08-12 18:16:51,Musk Always Cared About &#39;The Little Guy&#39; And Tesla Stock Split Shows That: WSJ&#39;s Higgins,TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced Tuesday a 5-for-1 stock split and this is consistent with CEO Elon Musk's belief in looking out for small investors, The Wall Street Journal's Tim Higgins said on CNBC.The 'Little Guy' Built Tesla: Musk's vision since taking Tesla public 10 years ago was to always want ""the little guy"" having a seat at the table as an investor, Higgins said. He noted that Musk set aside Tesla stocks for early Roadster buyers because he believed they ""helped make the company.""Tesla's stock split could be seen as a move consistent with Musk's vision. By splitting the stock price, buying one share will be more affordable to retail investors who don't want fractional ownership of a share through a platform like Robinhood.See Also: Experts React To Tesla Stock Split, Trading Action: 'Kind Of RidiculousMusk Is Selling A Vision: Musk continues to offer investors the same story presented years ago. Tesla is a ""narrative story"" about the future of transportation and even the world, Higgins said. This vision is ""pretty exciting"" to retail investors although experts and analysts might have to do ""very ambitious math"" to justify the current valuation.Nevertheless, retail investors believe the future of Tesla will include self-driving taxi cars and alternative energy offerings.""The fact that Elon Musk has gotten to this point, that four quarters of profitability, as messy as they may have been, suggests that he can execute,"" Higgins said.

2020-08-12 20:02:18,Stocks Briefly Erase Pandemic Losses; Oil Rallies: Markets Wrap,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks briefly surpassed the all-time closing high reached before the coronavirus pandemic, propelled by surging technology shares. The dollar weakened and Treasury yields rose to five-week highs.The S&P 500 climbed 1.4%, momentarily topping the 3,386.15 level reached on Feb. 19, and capping the more than 50% rally since the market lows in March. Ten of the benchmark index’s 11 industry sectors rose Wednesday, led by technology, health care and consumer discretionary shares. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed the S&P as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Tesla Inc. jumped. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose for a fourth day.“The main force that’s been driving markets the last few weeks has really been momentum,” said Kevin Caron, portfolio manager for Washington Crossing. “We’ve got a market that’s focused on the good case outcome for the virus, we’ve got a market that has taken a great deal of comfort in that fiscal policy is going to be there to support an economy through tough times.”Treasury yields dropped from the highs of the day after the government’s sale of $38 billion in 10-year notes attracted stronger-than-forecast demand.Silver joined gold in rebounding, as investors decided the flight from precious metals driven by advancing bond yields had gone too far.“It was just a matter of time. Once we hit 3,300, I think everybody knew we’d get to the new record before long,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “The question is whether we’ll rally further now that we’ve got it. I think we’ll take a breather now that we’ve reached the new high, which would actually be quite healthy.”After setting a new peak on Friday above $2,070 an ounce, bullion had since tumbled as much as 10%. Crude futures posted a five-month high in New York trading after an industry report pointed to a third straight weekly drop in American crude stockpiles.Elsewhere, Europe’s corporate bond spreads narrowed to their tightest since early March, just a few basis points off pre-virus levels, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index.Here are some key events coming up:Earnings include Tencent, Cisco Systems, Swiss Life, Tui AG.China releases a slew of data for July on Friday, including industrial production and retail sales.These are the main moves in markets:For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Not only will this new style take less volume for the same amount of battery, but it should also result in a weight reduction in the final vehicle, which improves efficiency.Tesla will be revealing the company's latest battery breakthroughs during Tesla's battery and investor day, Sept. 22.See more from Benzinga  * Rapid Progress Of Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin Shown In New Photo  * Tesla's Website Shows Mass Hiring For New Texas Gigafactory  * Report: Tesla Has Established Insurance Brokerage Company In China(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-14 07:57:26,Daimler to Pay $2.2 Billion to Settle U.S. Diesel Issues,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Daimler AG will pay about $2.2 billion to settle U.S. diesel-emissions issues in the latest fallout from years of closer regulatory scrutiny on vehicle pollution.An agreement in principle with authorities including the U.S. Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency will cost the German automaker roughly 1.27 billion euros ($1.5 billion), according to a statement. The Stuttgart-based company will pay another 592 million euros to settle class-action litigation brought by consumers.“While this hopefully resolves this issue and allows the company to focus on other pressing challenges, it is a reminder that other stakeholders are likely to receive the majority of Daimler’s cash flow in the period 2020-23 irrespective of underlying performance,” Citigroup Inc. analyst Angus Tweedie said in a note.Daimler shares fell 1.2% to 41.91 euros as of 9:55 a.m. in Frankfurt, in line with the Stoxx 600 Autos & Parts index. The shares are down 15% for the year.The pacts resolve issues that arose when U.S. regulators stepped up their examination of diesel emissions after Volkswagen AG’s cheating scandal emerged in 2015. The Justice Department asked Daimler to investigate its vehicle-certification process the following year.Although the costs add to Daimler’s financial headwinds triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the amounts are relatively small compared with the larger-scale emissions violations that have cost VW more than 30 billion euros. Daimler says it fully cooperated with U.S. authorities, whereas VW officials lied to EPA and California regulators before admitting the company created devices to defeat emissions tests.Daimler’s issues also involve fewer vehicles. Its agreement with U.S. authorities covers civil and environmental claims related to the emission-control systems of about 250,000 cars and vans. VW admitted in 2015 to rigging as many as 11 million diesel engines worldwide, including roughly 600,000 in the U.S.Emissions IssuesThe auto industry is still far from out of the woods with U.S. regulators.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV recently disclosed that it had started discussions with the Justice Department’s criminal division to resolve an investigation of diesel-emissions issues. Ford Motor Co. also revealed last year that its emissions-certification process may have been flawed and that the Justice Department had opened a criminal investigation.Electric-car maker Tesla Inc. has meanwhile posted a string of consecutive quarterly profits thanks in part to selling regulatory credits to carmakers that could not otherwise meet tougher pollution standards. The Model 3 maker’s market capitalization has soared past $300 billion, almost double VW, Daimler and Ford’s combined value.Years of ImpactDaimler expects to incur hundreds of millions of euros in additional expenses related to fulfilling the requirements of its settlements and said the costs will impact its business for the next three years.The company warned in its annual report published in February that German motor-industry watchdog KBA is likely to rule that additional vehicles are equipped with defeat devices. Daimler boosted provisions for legal and regulatory costs as a result.In its statement, Daimler said it has made sufficient provisions for the cost of the U.S. settlements. In the coming weeks, authorities will file consent decrees with a U.S. district court for final approval.A spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, one of the authorities involved in the settlements, said the consent decree is expected to be filed in mid-September. Representatives for the Justice Department and EPA declined to comment.(Updates with share performance and analyst comment from third paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

Murphy said Tesla is experiencing a self-fulfilling capital spiral in which momentum in Tesla's share price creates an opportunity to raise cheaper capital which drives Tesla's share price higher.""While we remain skeptical that TSLA will be the dominant EV automaker in the long-run, if a big global footprint can be built with no-cost capital, the 'growth' story would carry the day for the stock,"" Murphy said in the note.See Also: Morgan Stanley Goes All-In On Tesla Battery Day, Upgrades StockMurphy said Tesla's unlimited access to capital should clear the path for Tesla to accelerate its revenue growth rate to 50% annually over the next five years. However, he said Tesla's track record of growth and profitability up to this point is ""uninspiring"" given the company hasn't reached 500,000 unit sales per year after 17 years in operation.Murphy is projecting $11 in EPS for Tesla in 2020, and $13.50 in EPS in 2021.He said given the current interest rate climate and Tesla's skyrocketing share price, the company should have no problem executing further equity raises to fund its growth investments in the coming years.Benzinga's Take: With funding concerns seemingly eliminated, Tesla has no excuse for missing its growth targets.

2020-08-14 16:29:33,Lemonade Stock Is In for Turbulence. Buy Only If LMND Slides 30%,TSLA,Yahoo,"Investors looking to gamble this summer have had no shortage of options, as Lemonade's (NYSE:LMND) initial public offering (IPO) highlighted in July. LMND stock didn't disappoint, with shares of the loss-making insurance startup popping 138% on its first day of trading.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com A short while later, however, Lemonade's stock came back to earth a bit -- tumbling 30%. These losses might tempt investors to roll the dice again. But don't be fooled.Lemonade has a far higher risk profile the management likes to admit. Even though shares were a buy at its IPO price of $29, here's why investors should now wait for a better entry point.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips LMND Stock: What Does Lemonade Do?Before diving into the company's valuation, let's take a moment to understand what the Softbank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY)-backed Lemonade does.At its core, Lemonade is a Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance company. It writes insurance policies for homeowners and renters, much like competitors Allstate (NYSE:ALL), Farmers, Liberty Mutual, State Farm and Travelers (NYSE:TRV). Much like traditional P&C insurers, Lemonade then sells part of its premiums to reinsurance companies to transfer risk (Lemonade transfers 75% of premiums while retaining 25% on its books). What Makes Lemonade Different?The company simplifies buying home and renters insurance. Rather than spending time over the phone, customers can purchase insurance through an online bot. The process can take less than 30 seconds. And on the claims side, the company says that users can settle in as little as three seconds.Lured by a snazzy front-end website (and the promise of skipping phone-based customer service), millennials have flocked to Lemonade. Of the company's customers, 70% are under 35 according to SEC filings.And like its fintech peers, Lemonade has seen revenues skyrocket. Net earned premiums have exploded, rising 200% in 2019 alone. Gross loss ratios have also narrowed as the company gained scale, shrinking from an eye-watering 161% in 2017 to 79% in 2019. While not yet at industry standards of 65% - 68%, it's certainly moving in the right direction.That's why labeling Lemonade ""just"" a P&C company is much like calling Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) a car company or Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) an auto retailer. While technically correct, it misses the point that Matt McCall and my other colleagues have made. These companies are riding a wave of excitement over all things new-tech and digital.But can the excitement last? Lemonade Understates Three Key RisksLemonade's upbeat S-1 registration with the SEC seems to have its story in order: a digital upstart looking to gain share in a stodgy P&C market. The opportunity appears immense - the P&C insurance market is worth 2.1% of worldwide GDP.And targeting millennials have worked for other companies. Online health insurer Oscar, for instance, saw its Series A valuation of $800 million in 2015 balloon to $3.2 billion in just four years.Yet, not all is well once you peel back the layers of Lemonade's core business. A combination of three financial and economic realities stand in the way of this hot startup.   Risk No. 1: Pricing and Concentration of Premiums WrittenEven though LMND has a fancy front-end website, it's rear still looks like a P&C shop. And the insurance industry has long grappled with pricing risk. Although most P&C insurance is annually renewable, meaning actuaries can measure risks over a relatively short time horizon, the size of claims are often not known for several years.Lemonade's actuarial team will face a particularly steep learning curve in pricing personal liability in home insurance contracts. That's because Lemonade doesn't have a long operating history, and significant liability claims don't happen often. In other words, the company won't know its client risk profiles for years.If that wasn't enough, there's an even more significant issue: insurance concentration. It's the same reason why P&C insurers who specialize in beachfront Floridian property tend to go broke every time a major hurricane season hits the state. It doesn't matter how many people you insure if their risks are all the same.Stocks holders in LMND may unknowingly face a similar problem. Not only does the company have an outsized concentration among younger renters in urban and suburban areas. Over 60% of the company's gross written premiums come from just three states: California, Texas and New York.That means a localized significant disaster, such as a Californian earthquake or Texas hurricane, could cause a catastrophic loss for Lemonade. And even if the firm survives, its reinsurance policies will almost certainly rise.Don't underestimate these risks. The 2005 hurricane season, which included Dennis, Katrina and Wilma, weakened the P&C market so severely that even two years on, only one insurance company was able to write hurricane insurance for Florida's government. (The company, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B), walked away with a $224 million check)And as AIG's (NYSE:AIG) spectacular collapse showed the following year, even managers themselves can be oblivious to insurance risks even within their company. Risk No. 2: Lemonade Relies on Customer ExcitementLemonade has leaned heavily into its messaging to maintain its breakneck growth. ""Instant everything. No brainer prices. Big heart,"" the company proudly claims on its website.The company also operates as a ""Certified B Corp"" and has publicly stated it would give back excess profits to charity after deducting its fixed 25% fee.In good times, the growth-by-message strategy can work amazingly. For example, the office-sharing company WeWork, another SoftBank-backed startup, doubled membership between 2016-2017. Young office-workers flocked to the free beer and inclusive membership events.""When I hear Adam [founder of WeWork] speak and he talks about the We Generation,"" one member said in an interview with Wired, ""I really feel this, because everything that goes on in the world, it is just about what we can do for each other here.""Meanwhile, competitor Regus saw just 7% growth.In bad times, however, the same strategy can quickly collapse. In 2019, a series of missteps by CEO Adam Neumann rocked the WeWork brand. Among allegations of sexism and supporting a toxic frat-boy culture, Neuman also made several questionable stock sales from the company. He also trademarked the word ""We,"" then sold the rights back to WeWork for about $6 million.Softbank pulled the plug on WeWork's IPO, sending its valuation plummeting from $47 billion to $12 billion.Today, Lemonade walks a similar tightrope. Insurance companies already have a poor reputation among consumers, and a series of non-payment scandals by Lemonade (even if justified) could send the company into freefall. Customers might even question Lemonade's ""Certified B Corp"" status. In 2019, the company awarded $4.3 million in stock options to insiders but gave just $600,000 to charity.Not all growth-by-message companies fail; Tesla has defied critics for years now. But it does elevate the risk that when things fail, they can do so fast.   Risk No. 3: Profitability IssuesFinally, Lemonade has a severe profitability issue. The company lost $108.5 million in 2019 on just $63.8 million of net earned premium. In other words, the company lost almost $2 for every $1 it generated.The problem comes from the company's sky-high sales and marketing costs. In 2019, the company spent $89.1 million in marketing to generate just $42.6 million incremental premium.Its growing scale has helped margins to a degree. ""We currently spend $1 in marketing to generate more than $2 of in-force premium,"" management wrote in its most recent June 2020 report. But that's far from enough. A P&C company with a 70% loss ratio mathematically needs to generate $3.33 to cover just its marketing expenses. Just as the tooth fairy doesn't pay capital expenditure, Santa Claus doesn't pay worker salaries.To succeed, Lemonade will have to demonstrate that its online platform can bring in customers more efficiently than traditional players. Its established competitor, Everquote (NASDAQ:EVER), which deals only with the acquisition side of the business, spent 81 cents in advertising for every $1 of revenues. It has yet to turn a profit in its four years as a public company.Lemonade has other fierce competition ahead. Of the four largest homeowner insurance companies in the US, three (State Farm, Liberty Mutual and USAA) are mutual companies. That means they send 100% of their profits back to policyholders. The fourth, Allstate, generates twice as much from car insurance as it does from its homeowners business.Source: Data courtesy of Allstate 2019 Annual Report What's LMND Worth?By 2022, analysts expect revenue to rise to $346 million, which could increase to $1 billion by 2025 if all goes well. Lemonade already added on pet insurance, and more lines might get added. At that point, the company could be worth $4-$6 billion, about what Oscar Health Insurance is worth today. (For reference, Oscar generated $1.3 billion in 2019). That comes to $72 to $110 per LMND share or a 20%-83% upside.However, the company will need more capital to grow. The company already diluted existing shareholders with its $300 million IPO. More will be required.Also, Lemonade's three risk factors means investors should use a higher discount factor in determining fair value (that's an analyst's lazy way of pricing investment risk). A 10% annual discount rate lowers fair value to $46-$70 today. Hence CNBC personality and stock analyst Jim Cramer's note to ""back up the truck"" only if Lemonade's stock price falls below $50. Of the six analysts with stock price targets on LMND, only one has issued a ""buy"" rating.In a sense, Lemonade looks like a typical Softbank investment. Some of the Bank's holdings have marvelously; Arm, which the Bank bought for $31 billion in 2016, is now worth $55 billion by some estimates. Others, like WeWork, have lost the billions. Lemonade will follow a similar all-or-nothing path to profitability. Either the company will become the next Esurance (acquired by Allstate in 2011 for $1 billion) or it will blow up like so many other P&C insurers before it over mispriced risk.Whatever the case for investors, know this: LMND stock isn't for the faint of heart.

2020-08-14 16:59:45,Don’t Bet Against Innovation and Nikola Motors,TSLA,Yahoo,"Well that didn't take long. In just three months as a public company, upstart next-gen commercial truck maker Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) replaced Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as the market's biggest battleground stock, with bears and bulls both digging in their heels on Nikola stock.Source: Stephanie L Sanchez / Shutterstock.com The bulls think Nikola projects as the Tesla of the commercial trucking space, and that the transportation electrification megatrend will turn Nikola into a global trucking powerhouse. The bears, meanwhile, see Nikola as an unproven, highly speculative company with tons of execution risks, none of which they believe are factored into the NKLA stock price today.Spoiler alert: The bulls are right.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhy?Because innovation always wins, and Nikola is one of the most innovative, forward-thinking companies on the planet.Plus, all that innovation is supported by big strategic and manufacturing partnerships, a huge pre-order book, a balance sheet flush with capital and an engineering team beaming with talent - the sum of which mitigates execution risks and lends visibility to Nikola turning today's breakthroughs, into tomorrow's profits.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListIn other words, Nikola really is Tesla 2.0, and NKLA stock really is a strong buy for long-term investors. Here's a deeper look. Don't Bet Against InnovationOne thing I've learned in markets is that a bet against innovation is often a losing bet.And, at this point in time, a bet against Nikola stock is a bet against innovation, mostly because it conceptually stands as a bet against the idea that commercial trucking fleets all across the globe will be electrified over the next 10-plus years.Make no mistake about it. That's exactly what will happen.Increasing social and legislative pressure on companies to reduce carbon emissions - coupled with rising fuel costs, falling alternative energy costs and improve alternative fuel technology - will promote ubiquitous adoption of next-gen, smart, zero-emission vehicles over the next few decades, on both the consumer and commercial sides of the market.That means zero-emission cars. Zero-emission trains. Zero-emission boats. And, yes, zero-emission commercial trucks.In that last auto vertical, Nikola is king, because of innovation. The company has spent, over the past several years, developing a robust technological platform upon which its engineers constructed next-generation, zero-emission trucks which represent the cutting edge of everything.I'm talking heavy duty commercial trucks with industry-leading driving range and industry-best recharging times. Trucks that are built on premium software that is autonomous ready. Trucks that look sleek, have a futuristic feel, can haul nearly as much as diesel trucks and have lower and more predictable unit costs that diesel trucks.In other words, Nikola really is the trucking company of the future.Betting against that feels like a bet against innovation, and that's a bet that probably won't win in the long run. Clear Value PropAnother thing to like about the Nikola growth narrative is the fact that the company's trucks have such a clear value prop, that once the company ramps up production, commercial fleet adoption should be relatively seamless and happen very quickly.Nikola's hydrogen-electric trucks are zero-emission. They have lower and more predictable unit costs. They have nearly equal hauling capacity. And, they have reached parity with diesel trucks in terms of driving range and recharging time.In other words, with Nikola's next-gen trucks, commercial trucking fleets will be gaining a whole lot, without losing anything.That value prop is as clear as day.And because it as clear as day, widespread adoption of Nikola's next-gen vehicles - once the company mass produces them - could be very, very quick. Strong FundamentalsOf course, despite the aforementioned positives, NKLA stock bears will continue to hang their hat on the fact that Nikola hasn't sold a single one of these next-gen trucks, and that accordingly, the growth narrative has huge execution risks.But it doesn't really.Sure, Nikola hasn't sold a single next-gen heavy duty truck yet. But the company has a long list of strategic investment and manufacturing partners which, in it of itself, lends credibility to this company's engineering prowess and ability to scale production.The company also has a huge pre-order book that totals over $10 billion, a balance sheet flush with capital (more than $900 million in cash), a top-tier engineering team which includes several former Tesla engineers and one of the most exciting growth narratives in the world which will inevitably only attract more top-tier talent.In other words, Nikola hasn't sold a single vehicle yet, but they have the partners, the customers, the resources, the talent and the energy to sell tens of thousands of trucks per year at scale.That's exactly what the company will do.If (when) they do, NKLA stock will be worth a whole lot more than $45. NKLA to $200?By my numbers, NKLA stock could soar to nearly $200 over the next decade.Here are those numbers.Each year, commercial fleet companies buy around 2.7 million heavy-duty and manufacturing commercial trucks globally. Within the next decade, I see around 1 in every 3 of those truck sales being a zero-emission truck, for a total of roughly 900,000 hydrogen-electric commercial trucks sold in 2030.Nikola projects to be the Tesla of this space. In the passenger car market, Tesla has consistently controlled between 10% and 15% of the EV vertical. Assuming similar market share for Nikola at scale, that translates to over 110,000 truck sales in 2030.Average sales price tag on those trucks will be about $250,000, for total truck revenue of about $28 billion.The hydrogen and services business will simultaneously ramp as Nikola builds out a robust network of hydrogen charging stations. I think that business grows to about $6 billion in revenue by the end of the decade, implying total revenues of $34 billion.Management is guiding for 22% gross margins by 2024. I think that number grows to 25% by 2030. Meanwhile, the opex rate will likely compress to industry-average levels around 7%, for total operating margins in the 18% range.My modeling suggests that under those assumptions ($34 billion in revenue/18% operating margins), Nikola could hit $10 in earnings per share by 2030.Based on a 20-times forward multiple, that implies a 2029 price target for NKLA stock of $200. Bottom Line on Nikola StockWhen it comes to Nikola stock, the bull thesis is pretty simple.Don't bet against innovation.Nikola represents the future of the trucking industry, and while the company's innovation is accompanied by execution risks, those executions are relatively mitigated by strong fundamentals. These include a long list of big strategic partners, a clear pathway to manufacturing ramp, a balance sheet flush with capital and an engineering team beaming with talent.Could Nikola fail? Sure.But it's far more likely that the company succeeds is disrupting the $600-plus billion global trucking market.And if the company does, NKLA stock will soar over the next five to 10 years.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

2020-08-14 18:30:14,Consider Workhorse Stock A Cautious Buy on The Pullback,TSLA,Yahoo,"As the EV sector remains hot, should you buy Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) stock? Rallying more than 400% so far this year, investors have started to hit the brakes. Reaching prices as high as $22.90 per share in early July, the electric-powered delivery truck maker's shares have slipped down to around $16 per share.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com It's no surprise shares have fared so well in recent months. With speculators buying up anything remotely EV-related, smaller names like this one have seen gains that make the strong returns of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) seem mild by comparison.Yet, as those trading EV stocks on FOMO and momentum take profits, can this potential disruptor hold onto its recent gains? It's debatable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn one hand, the company has a strong catalyst on the horizon. I'm talking about the potential for the company to win a lucrative contract with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Add in the company's stake in EV startup Lordstown Motors, and there may be more backing the Workhorse rally than just mere speculation.On the other hand, like with rivals such as Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA), it's been promises, promises rather than tangible results driving shares. With minimal sales right now, this company has much to prove in the eyes of investors.So, what's the play here? Do you fade the recent rally, as shares trend lower? Or do you go long, as the USPS and Lordstown catalysts may put shares back into hyperdrive? It's a tough call. But, given the potential for shares to rally substantially higher than cratering back to single-digits, a cautious buy today may be worthwhile. WKHS Stock, Earnings, and USPS CatalystWith this company still in startup mode, current earnings shouldn't be a big deal. Yet, that didn't stop Workhorse stock from selling off after its quarterly results release earlier this week. With losses for the period higher than expected, should investors be concerned?  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List Probably not. It's the likelihood of potential needle-movers in motion that should be top of mind. Namely, whether the company can beat the odds, and win a multi-billion dollar deal with USPS.As InvestorPlace's Alex Sirois wrote Aug 5, Workhorse has long-shot odds to win the USPS Fleet Upgrade contract. Given that the company's truck body partner dropped out of its bidding team, and larger truck makers are also in the running, it's safe to say this company is not a top contender.That doesn't mean it's all sizzle and no steak with Workhorse. Scoring small wins, like the partnership deal with Ryder (NYSE:R), the company is slowly building up its business. But, beyond the prospects for the company's main operating business, there's another asset on the books that could help drive shares higher.I'm talking about the company's 10% stake in Lordstown Motors. With that EV truck maker soon going public via a reverse merger, could it fuel a bounce back for WKHS stock? Lordstown Motors Going PublicLordstown Motors, formed just last year, gets its namesake from a shuttered auto plant it acquired from General Motors (NYSE:GM). GM is the largest investor in the company. But, Workhorse has had a major hand in the deal.The company's founder, Steve Burns, jumped ship to start Lordstown. Also, Workhorse licensed its pickup truck intellectual property in exchange for licensing fees, as well as a 10% equity interest.And now, this privately-held startup is going public via a reverse merger with DiamondPeak (NASDAQ:DPHC). Similar to the way Nikola went public, Lordstown's merger partner is a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company.Considering how well SPAC stocks like Nikola, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) have performed, could the same thing happen here?It's possible. Right now, its stake in Lordstown is worth around $160 million. But, if DPHC shares take off like other SPAC names post-merger, this stake could become worth many times more. Such a scenario could help put points into Workhorse shares.On the other hand, what's to say enthusiasm for SPAC stocks will continue? If interest in ""SPAC-mania"" cools off, this catalyst won't do much to move this company's shares higher. Very Risky, But Workhorse May Be Worth ItWith future potential, not current results, driving valuation, it seems risky to jump into Workhorse after its recent epic run. Yet, the potential upside from the company's main catalysts (USPS contract win, Lordstown investment) may exceed the risk shares fall back to single-digits.So, what's the call right now? Consider WKHS stock a cautious buy.

2020-08-14 19:08:56,Here’s The Only Safe Way To Buy Tesla Stock,TSLA,Yahoo,"Back on June 30, I wrote about how Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) was grossly overvalued and a dangerous speculation. In less than two months since that story, the stock is down 36.3%. I still think NKLA stock, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock and other electric vehicle stocks are caught in a market bubble.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.com I've repeatedly told investors to stay away from Tesla, Nikola and other EV stocks. At least stay away until the bubble deflates a bit more and the valuations come back down to earth.However, savvy investors can take advantage of a technique known as pair trading to buy Tesla today, even at its current ridiculous valuation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips What's Wrong With TSLA Stock At $1,400?TSLA stock has already taken a big hit since late July. The irrational exuberance for the stock seems to have started to fade. But Tesla still has a long way to go to the downside before it is reasonably valued. Tesla trades at about 91.2 times forward earnings. Auto competitors Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) trade at an average forward earnings multiple of 9.9. Tesla trades at 10.5 times sales. Ford, GM and Toyota trade at 0.43 times sales.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List But since Tesla bulls argue that the company is the next tech giant, like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), let's make another comparison. Those tech stocks have an average forward earnings multiple of around 42, a more than 50% discount to TSLA stock. They also trade at an average price-to-sales ratio of 7.35, a 30% discount to Tesla.Tesla isn't the only stock caught in the EV bubble. There are dozens. But Nikola may be one of the most egregiously valued of all. I'd love to compare Nikola's earnings and sales multiples to Tesla's, but Nikola has none. Nikola essentially has no earnings or sales to speak of. Why Tesla Over Nikola?In a vacuum, I think investors should stay away from TSLA stock for a number of reasons. Valuation is simply the biggest. But compared to Nikola, Tesla looks like a dream investment.Essentially, both Tesla and Nikola are story stocks. Story stocks aren't valued on the viability of their business models, their growth and profit metrics or the health of their balance sheets. They are valued based on the stories the company tells investors about how great things will be in the future. For example, Tesla's revenue was down 4.9% in the second quarter despite launching the Model Y and the opening of its China gigafactory. But just look at how many products the company has in development. Cybertruck, semi truck, Roadster, fully-autonomous Autopilot, and now (not kidding) Tesla spaceship are all in various stages of research and development.I'm always skeptical of story stocks because they tend to price in the perfect storybook ending before the end of the first chapter of the book. I wrote that Nikola was already priced to perfection back in July. But Tesla and Nikola are both story stocks, and they both have the same story. Investors are betting that these tiny companies with negligible or nonexistant global market share will eventually grow to dominate the world auto market over time.Like I said, I'm skeptical of that story. But if somebody asked me which company is more likely to make that fairy tale come true, it's got to be Tesla. How To Play ItFor the record, I'm not a fan of TSLA stock at all. In fact, I think there's a strong possibility stock could underperform over the next 10 or 15 years.But this trade isn't about if Tesla will be trading at $20 or $2,000 in two years. It's strictly about Tesla outperforming Nikola.I'm recommending traders go long TSLA stock and short Nikola. Nikola likely has a bright future of long-term growth ahead of it. But its market cap of $16.3 billion is crazy considering the company doesn't even have a product on the market at this point.Nikola and Tesla are two story stocks with the same story and the same happy ending. But if the growth story is a 300-page novel, Tesla is on page 25, while Nikola is only on page four. If Nikola wins in the long-term, I'm betting Tesla will win bigger. And If Tesla loses, I'm betting Nikola will end up worthless.Wayne Duggan has been a U.S. News & World Report Investing contributor since 2016 and is a staff writer at Benzinga, where he has written more than 7,000 articles.

CNBC's Jim Cramer went over during his ""Mad Money"" show what he calls his ""seven deadly sins of investing.""1\. No Cheerleading: There is no room for ""cheerleading"" in stocks, Cramer said. Instead of cheering a winning stock in hopes it goes even higher, take some profits off the table, the CNBC host said. ""Buy low, sell high -- not buy low, cheerlead high."" 2\. Don't Fall Into Momentum Traps: Investors need to avoid buying stocks for the simple reason that they're going up, Cramer said. In fact, investors should be able to understand how a company makes money and list three reasons for buying the stock.3\. Don't Look For The Next Big Thing: There is one and only one Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the market, Cramer said. ""Stop trying to find the next Tesla when you can just buy Tesla,"" he said.4\. Avoid Low-Dollar Stocks: Investors may assume they've found a winner when buying a low-dollar stock. But there is often a reason why a stock is cheap: ""management stinks,"" Cramer said.5\. Avoid Penny Stocks: Penny stocks are plagued with pump-and-dump schemes. Those that aren't are likely drowning in debt.""You shouldn't even think about owning a single-digit stock unless you know how to read a balance sheet,"" Cramer said.6\. Don't Be Greedy: Investors sitting on a ""monster gain"" shouldn't make the mistake of sitting on their stock, Cramer said.Instead, investors may want to cash out the initial investment and ""let the rest run so you're playing with the house's money.""7\. Stop Heckling: Heckling pundits, especially Cramer himself, is ""not a strategy,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.""I'm here as your investing coach. My job is to find good companies and recommend their stocks when the price is right,"" he said.

Machine learning is then used to analyze the environment and move the car to the target location. The vehicle uses equipped sensors to gather data and find a safe path to the given destination. Benzinga's Take: While Tesla has many patents, the company is known for being open with the technology in its patents, especially if it pertains to safety.But Tesla is the first company to make such an advancement, and it is a good idea for them to protect this invention. Smart summon was a very popular feature when it was first released, but a lack of improvement in the ability has led to many owners abandoning the feature until upgrades are seen.

Jonas lifted the price target to $1,360 (17.6% downside potential) from $1,050.The rating upgrades come just days after Tesla announced a 5:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend and stated that shares will begin trading on a split adjusted basis on Aug. 31.

Two-factor authentication via sms or authenticator app is going through final validation right now,"" Musk said, responding to the tweets of his followers.It isn't immediately clear from Musk's announcement whether Tesla would choose to implement two-factor authentication through text messages or a phone authenticator app, such as one made by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). Users could have the option to opt for either mechanism as well.The company's app offers critical functionality to drivers, including granting them entry to the vehicles and enabling them to monitor battery charging.Why It Matters Two-factor authentication adds another layer of security to a website or an app, which can prevent unauthorized entry in case a users' password is compromised.The phone authenticator app method of two-factor verification is thought to be more secure than authentication by text message, TechCrunch noted earlier.Musk first mentioned two-factor authentication in May 2019 and said in April that it was ""coming soon."" Tesla owners have become more vociferous in demanding the security measure, according to TechCrunch.After Twitter Inc's (NYSE: TWTR) platform was hijacked in July, affecting several high-profile accounts, including Musk's, cybersecurity experts recommend two-factor authentication, along with other measures to protect critical apps.Price Action Tesla shares closed nearly 1.8% higher at $1,650.71 on Friday and fell almost 0.3% in the after-hours session.Photo courtesy: Steve Jurvetson on FlickrSee more from Benzinga  * Nikola Keen On Hydrogen Tech Collaboration With Hyundai, Even After Two Rejections  * Tesla Battery Supplier CATL Says Working On New Tech That Could Increase EV Range To Over 500 Miles  * Tesla's 'Ulterior Motive' In Suing Rivian Was To Malign Its Image, Threaten Employees, Rival Retorts(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-08-17 12:42:06,Options Measures Suggest Fervor for Technology Shares May Ebb,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Options measures that recently were showing extreme optimism about technology stocks are now coming off, a sign to RBC Capital Markets that it might be worth deploying some hedges.Skew, which measures the cost of bearish options versus bullish ones, had recently gone to lows on stocks like Facebook Inc. and Tesla Inc., showing not only general demand for upside, but strong speculative fervor as investors bet on big further gains. That’s reversing now, according to RBC Capital Markets derivatives strategist Amy Wu Silverman.“Short term antsiness is starting to play out in some of the market’s most beloved names,” Wu Silverman wrote in a note Sunday. “We are seeing pickups in skew in FANGMAN stocks where call exuberance reigned supreme all summer,” she said, using an acronym to refer to the biggest of large-cap stocks like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. She added, “The most common question I receive from portfolio managers is: how do I hedge my winners?”The softening in bullish behavior comes as the S&P 500 loses momentum near its February record high. And the megacaps have “acted so well for such a long time that they could be due for a breather,” according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co.“With one- and two-month skew picking up in megacap Tech, consider put spreads to hedge winners heading into fall,” Wu Silverman recommended. And on a longer-term horizon, she suggested a trade involving selling a call and buying a put, saying: “call skew premiums are still hefty versus S&P through January 2021. Use zero-cost collars to take advantage of this landscape.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-08-17 13:30:02,The Case for Discretionary Spending in a Recession,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- With fewer opportunities to travel and dine out, as well as more financial worries around the damaged economy and job market, Americans are stashing cash at an unprecedented rate.  The latest government data show a personal savings rate of 19% in June. That’s down from April’s peak of 34%, when much of the country was in lockdown due to Covid-19, unemployment surged to almost 15% and consumer confidence crashed. To compare, the most we ever saved during the previous 2009 recession was a little more than 8% of disposable income.  Assuming you have a steady stream of income, a good chunk in savings and zero credit card debt, is now an OK time to start spending again? That is, on things other than housing, groceries and masks? Should you spring for that new Tesla or commit to those home upgrades? With interest rates so low, maybe there’s even merit to financing the expense? In the current climate, the thought of spending on anything that’s not a “necessity” can, to some, feel irresponsible — even when you have your financial ducks in a row.For example, someone recently asked me about proceeding to use a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to remodel her kitchen. She’s been planning the project for two years, has already purchased the cabinets and has a stable income. But part of her wonders if she’ll regret her beautiful new kitchen if she faces a financial setback down the road. And might it even be insensitive to make a splashy purchase when so much of the country is pulling back? (Technically, she would be contributing to GDP growth and helping the economy, but I get it.)In this case, and in many others, I’d argue that moving forward with the plan to spend is the rational choice, so long as a few caveats are kept in mind. If you’re stuck on a financial decision, here’s what to consider: Have a firm cash position. Cash is paramount right now. If you made this purchase, how would it impact your liquidity, the money you could quickly access if you were to get in a bind? It is likely more than affordable if, afterwards, you still have enough money to cover a minimum of six to nine months-worth of necessary expenses. I suggest this time frame because even though it’s a hard job market right now, if you fell out of the workforce, there’s a good chance you could get back on your feet within the year. Currently, the average amount of time it’s taking for an unemployed person to find a new job is about 18 weeks.Let’s say you’re eyeing new living room furniture that will cost $5,500. As long as that doesn’t eat into your rainy-day savings by much or at all, you’re in the safe zone. You could still make the purchase, but just commit to refueling your savings over the next four to five pay cycles if need be.  Be clear on the cost benefits. Will this expense pay off? Will it make your life better or easier? A purchase’s benefits to our social and emotional well-being should count for something, especially in these times when we’re more stressed and anxious. Sure, you could continue working at the kitchen table using your 2006 Macbook pro, but if turning a spare bedroom into a home office and buying a newer laptop offers you the productivity, privacy and comfort to be ten times better at your job, then it’s a fine investment in my book.  Make financing feasible. Taking on debt to spend on something that’s not an actual need in a pandemic-recession sounds kind of backwards on paper. But in reality, financing a purchase at today’s low interest rates isn’t a bad idea, especially if it’s one that could provide you with more mobility, freedom and happiness, such as a vehicle.Let’s go back to the needing cash in the bank. If financing provides you with the ability to stay more liquid, and you can very easily pay down a cheap loan with your paycheck (and in a worst-case scenario, with your rainy-day account), then there’s little to fear. All the while, be smart about what you’re buying. If you want a car, consider a certified pre-owned model and show the dealer your researched cost-comparisons to negotiate the lowest possible price. After all, just because you can spend, doesn’t mean you should pay full price. Same goes for the kitchen remodel you’ve been dreaming about. We’re spending nearly all of our time now at home, so allocating funds to make the space more accommodating and pleasure-filled is money well spent. Following the above steps, a home renovation spells low-risk and high-reward. If you’re fortunate to score a home equity line of credit, since some major lenders have stopped providing them at the moment, aim to use only what you can pay back within the next year. To keep it comfortable, keep your monthly HELOC payment balance to no more than 10% of your monthly budget.Quit the guilt. If you’re feeling bad about spending big bucks because it’s not a good “look” right now, remember that shopping is not a zero-sum game. Buying something for yourself doesn’t mean that someone else necessarily goes without. But I understand how it can weigh on one’s conscience. My advice: Rather than feel guilt, feel grateful for your advantages and being in a position to afford this expense. It’s proven that expressing gratitude helps lead to more happiness, better relationships and improved health among other benefits. If the purchase is still weighing on you, consider donating your time, money or belongings to the causes you feel most passionate about. You can always find ways to meaningfully give back, especially now. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Farnoosh Torabi is a financial journalist, author and host of the ""So Money"" podcast.

He said Tesla appears back on track to hit its guidance of 500,000 global deliveries in 2020.""We believe that the China growth story is worth at least $400 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3 (million mile battery remains an elusive goal now in the grasp in our opinion),"" Ives wrote in the note.Ives said success in China is a ""paradigm changer"" for Tesla's long-term global EV penetration story.At the same time, Ives said Tesla's million-mile battery could be a major value creator in the long-term, potentially making the company a major third-party supplier to other automakers. Tesla will make a number of major battery announcements at its Battery Day event on Sept. 22.Benzinga's Take: As is the case with many other Wall Street analysts, Ives seems to love all the news coming from Tesla and expects massive growth from the company in the coming years. Yet with the stock up 710% in the past year and Tesla's market cap at $324 billion, he is unwilling to recommend buying the stock at its current valuation.Tesla's stock traded around $17,91 at the time of publication.Related Links:BofA Upgrades Tesla, Doubles Price Target; Says Growth Story Could 'Carry The Day'Experts React To Tesla Stock Split, Trading Action: 'Kind Of Ridiculous'Latest Ratings for TSLA  DateFirmActionFromTo  Aug 2020WedbushMaintainsNeutral  Aug 2020B of A SecuritiesUpgradesUnderperformNeutral  Aug 2020Morgan StanleyUpgradesUnderweightEqual-Weight    View More Analyst Ratings for TSLA   View the Latest Analyst Ratings See more from Benzinga  * Experts React To Tesla Stock Split, Trading Action: 'Kind Of Ridiculous'  * 2 Years Since 'Funding Secured' Firestorm, Musk And Tesla Are Flying High(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Rosner noted that during GM's conference call with analysts after the second-quarter earnings report on July 29, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra responded to his question about a potential spinoff by saying that GM was evaluating that option. Rosner believes an EV spinoff would force the market to recognize its EV technology and upcoming vehicle lineup, ""unlock considerable shareholder value, give the new entity access to cheap capital and provide the new entity with the ability to attract high-caliber talent. He said an evaluation of potential valuation outcomes could value GM's stock between $28 to up to $93, which represents a decline of 2.5% to a more than tripling (up 224%) from current levels. The stock has lost 21.6% year to date, while shares of rival Ford Motor Co.  have dropped 25.8% and EV-maker Tesla Inc.'s stock has rocketed fourfold (up 322.6%), and the S&P 500  has gained 4.8%."

2020-08-17 17:52:32,Tesla Extends Rally With Market Value Nearing Consumer Giant P&G,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- The relentless rally in Tesla Inc. shares has driven its valuation close to the consumer product behemoth Procter & Gamble Co. as investors bet on the electric vehicle maker’s ability to dominate the automotive market of the future.The stock jumped as much as 8.9% to a record intraday high of $1,796.98 in New York on Monday, despite reports of a drop in the registrations of Chinese-made Tesla cars in July. China is a key market for Tesla, and the company is ramping up production there after starting deliveries from its massive Shanghai plant around the beginning of the year.Tesla shares are now up 327% this year, fueled by growing anticipation that the company will be included in the S&P 500 Index. The carmaker’s plan to split its stock into a 5-for-1 exchange to make shares more accessible for individual investors is also expected to drive up demand. Tesla was the eighth most popular stock on the Robinhood app on Monday, according to data from Robintrack.net.Meanwhile, Wall Street has warmed to the stock, as evidenced by a steady stream of upgrades and price target boosts. The latest came from Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who raised his target to $1,900 from $1,800, saying Tesla has seen strong demand in Europe and China so far in the third quarter, with the U.S. market remaining softer.“The China growth story is worth at least $400 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this electric vehicle penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months,” Ives wrote. He kept his bull-case target at $2,500.Tesla’s market value is hovering around $333.7 billion, just shy of P&G’s $336.6 billion, which places the maker of Pampers and Crest as the 11th biggest stock on the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data. Retail giant Walmart has the 10th biggest valuation on the index, at $384.3 billion.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-08-17 21:46:49,GM Shares Soar on Electric-Car Spin-Off Speculation,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co. shares rose to their highest level in almost three months after a Deutsche Bank analyst speculated the automaker could spin off its electric-vehicle unit to create more value.The stock pared a gain of as much as 10.5% in Monday trading before closing up 7.7% at $30.01 a share -- the biggest one-day jump since May 18 and its highest close since June 8. That came after Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner wrote in a report published Monday the automaker could be worth as much as $93 a share if GM spins out its electric-vehicle business.GM has pondered such a move recently, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, reviving an idea first mulled internally two years ago. A spokesman declined to comment beyond referring to the remarks its chief executive officer, Mary Barra, made last month.When asked about the possibility on a July 31 second-quarter earnings call, CEO Barra didn’t dismiss the idea, saying “nothing is off the table,” though the company has said nothing about preparing for it.GM does plan to sell more than 20 EV models around 2023. That business could be spun off for $20 billion and eventually be worth as much as $100 billion, the Deutsche Bank report said. GM’s core business selling gasoline-powered sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks is generating cash but viewed as being in long-term decline and is less exciting to investors than the company’s electric-car plans, it said.Despite the share gains Monday, the Detroit-based automaker’s stock is down 18% so far this year while all-electric rival Tesla Inc.’s value is eight times that of GM. By spinning off its EV business, GM could get the kind of momentum enjoyed by Tesla and a handful of startups that have lured capital despite their having no vehicles on the market.Battery-powered cars have caught the imagination of investors in recent weeks, sending shares of Tesla to successive record levels and boosting the value of electric startups such as Nikola Inc., Fisker Inc. and Lordstown Motors Corp., all of which took a fast track chasing public listings after being acquired by special purpose acquisition companies.(Corrects lede paragraph to state shares closed at an almost three-month high)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

(NASDAQ: TSLA) is mired in a dispute with the Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ: PDD) over the pricing of its Model 3 vehicles on the latter's portal, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.What Happened The simmering discord is over a customer in Wuhan, China who noticed a Tesla Model 3 being sold 7% cheaper at $36,320 than the official post-subsidy price set by Tesla at YiAuto, a car retailer in Fujian, according to Bloomberg.Once the Elon Musk-led company became aware of the discounted price, it reportedly denied any cooperation with both Pinduoduo and the car retailer. Nevertheless, YiAuto came through with the offer and the Wuhan man ordered the car, which was booked through Tesla's website using the buyer's details. Why It Matters The electric vehicle maker termed the purchase a resale, which resulted in the loss of privileges reserved for buyers of Tesla vehicles through the company-approved outlets, Bloomberg noted. A representative of the automotive company said that it was willing to compensate for the buyer's loss of time and effort and he was welcome to re-place his order via official channels. The Chinese e-commerce firm criticized Tesla for making it difficult for fans to get their ""dream car."" ""We appreciate the trust that our users put in our platform and will do everything we can do protect their rights,"" Pinduoduo told Bloomberg.Pinduoduo, which has more than 628 million active buyers might be considering a lawsuit against the EV maker, Teslarati reported, citing local Chinese media.

Ives said ""We continue to believe EV demand in China is starting to accelerate in July/August with Tesla competing with a number of domestic and international competitors for market share with Giga 3 remaining the linchpin of success which remains the prize that Musk and Tesla are laser focused on capturing.""The analyst added ""We are seeing more leverage in the story now on the horizon out of Giga 3 along with some price cuts both in the US and China that could further stimulate demand as the macro starts to improve and the lockdown conditions ease globally. We believe Tesla thus far in 3Q has seen strong demand in Europe and China with the US market remaining softer.""Looking ahead, Wedbush expects Tesla to announce a number of new potential ""game changing"" battery developments at its Battery Day on Sept. 22.""In theory this battery will support an electric vehicle for 1 million miles and be a major step forward when competing vs. traditional gasoline powered automotive competitors from both an ROI and environmental perspective,"" Ives said.Currently, the rest of the Street is sidelined on the stock. The Hold analyst consensus is based on 15 Holds, 4 Buys, and 9 Sells. The average price target of $1,295 implies downside potential of about 29.5% to current levels.

There was also a brief mention of the next jump in performance, simply called Hardware 4.0.Now a new report out of China makes mention of TSMC making an initial run of processor production with Tesla near the end of 2020. These new chips will use TSMC's 7nm fabrication process.Tesla's Hardware 3 computer was made with Samsung. Electrek makes mention that this could be the beginning of production for Tesla's Hardware 4.0 computer, since it is expected to be in mass production by the end of 2021, but the original source makes no mention of that.Benzinga's Take: Tesla looks to be fully integrated, whether it's the seats they produce, computer hardware or even providing the means to produce energy for your vehicle in the form of solar panels.Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) made a similar move last year when it ditched Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in favor of its in-house designed chip.Hardware 4.0 also seems a possibility as Tesla's next vehicle, the Cybertruck, is expected to launch around the same time that this new TSMC chip is reportedly planned for mass production.

SpaceX plans to sell another $165 million in equity and preferred stock.Seventy-five investors have participated in the latest round of funding, which will value the company at $46 billion, Bloomberg News reported last week. That would rank SpaceX as one of the most valuable venture-backed U.S. companies.SpaceX’s fundraising comes during a fertile period, both for the Tesla Inc. sister company and capital markets more broadly. Technology companies, Tesla in particular, have been especially favored as the stock market flirts with a record high.Tuesday’s filing came the same day that SpaceX made a record sixth flight for one of its Falcon 9 rocket boosters. The company delivered 58 of the company’s Starlink satellites to orbit, along with three SkySat satellites for Planet Labs Inc.SpaceX has said that the latest version of the Falcon’s first stage can fly at least 10 times without major refurbishment. The Florida launch also marked more than 50 successful landings for the rocket’s first stage.The company has launched more than 600 satellites for Starlink, a high-speed Internet network that could begin commercial service late this year for customers in northern North America.On Aug. 2, SpaceX successfully returned two astronauts from the International Space Station after a 64-day mission. The SpaceX Dragon demonstration trip, which began May 30, was the first time a private contractor had flown National Aeronautics and Space Administration personnel aboard a private spacecraft. SpaceX’s first regular taxi flight for NASA, scheduled for mid-October, will take four astronauts to the space station.Meanwhile, SpaceX is constructing prototypes in Boca Chica, Texas, of its heavy-lift Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. The company plans in 2023 to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and his guests on the first private space-tourism jaunt around the moon.On Aug. 4 a Starship prototype called SN5 flew about 500 feet high before landing successfully. A similar craft, SN6, may perform a similar test this month. SpaceX ultimately plans to fly as many as 100 people aboard the 394-foot (120-meter) tall Starship back and forth to the moon and Mars.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-08-19 05:00:00,A Huge Tesla Bet Pays Off Big for one British Fund,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- A British fund that has grown more than seven times faster than peers this year has one big bet to thank.Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust Plc’s holding of 1.87 million shares in Tesla Inc. has increased in value by more than $2 billion since the end of March as the electric carmaker’s stock price has surged to a record. That, along with investments in other U.S. tech giants and stay-at-home winners, means the fund has provided a year-to-date return of 55% versus 7.1% for its peer group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The growth of the closed-end investment fund -- which these days is global and has nothing to do with its roots in mortgages -- has helped cement its position in the U.K.’s FTSE 100 benchmark. The shares are among the index’s top five winners of 2020 with a gain that matches its fund performance. Tesla now accounts for about 11% of 12.8 billion pounds ($16.9 billion) in total assets, even though the fund trimmed its stake earlier this year.Scottish Mortgage “has benefited from good stock picks as well as being in sectors which have been favored during the global pandemic,” Robert Starkey, an analyst at investment research group Morningstar, said in emailed comments. Looking slightly longer-term, its net asset value has more than doubled over the past three years, the fund’s website shows.Other stocks among the fund’s top ten holdings have been beneficiaries of stay-at-home trends due to the Covid-19 pandemic, including e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., streaming group Netflix Inc., and food-delivery service provider Delivery Hero SE.Yet it’s Tesla that has been at the forefront of its outperformance. The carmaker’s stock has more than quadrupled this year, fueled by a better-than-expected performance in China and growing anticipation that the company will be included in the S&P 500 Index.Scottish Mortgage is one of many funds run by Baillie Gifford & Co. that own Tesla stock. That makes the Edinburgh-based investment-management firm the company’s largest shareholder behind co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk with a stake across all its funds of about 6.3%.Stake TrimmedScottish Mortgage’s gains would have been even greater had it not cut its stake in Tesla by about 125,000 shares in the first quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In doing so, the fund missed out on about $164 million in additional value, based on Aug. 17 closing prices.Among Scottish Mortgage’s current top 20 equity holdings by market value, Tesla was the only one whose stake was reduced during the first half of the year, Bloomberg data show.In trimming the holding, the fund’s managers were making adjustments to reflect their views “on the overall balance of the portfolio rather than simply the individual Tesla holding,” a spokesman said by email. “The managers remain supportive holders of Tesla,” he said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-08-19 06:30:10,Germany and Detroit Already Have Their Own Teslas,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- When finance types talk about internal combustion engines, they often just use the abbreviation ICE. It’s an appropriate name: Investors have a frosty view of car companies that depend on petrol or diesel to power their vehicles.Volkswagen AG, the world’s biggest auto maker by sales, has a market value of 73 billion euros ($87 billion), or about 6.5 times the earnings it generated last year. By contrast, Tesla Inc.’s all-electric lineup has propelled it to an astonishing $352 billion valuation even though its profits are tiny. Budding Teslas such as Rivian Automotive Inc. and Nikola Corp. have achieved multi-billion dollar valuations before even delivering their first electric vehicles.The traditional industry giants of Germany and Detroit, such as Volkswagen and General Motors Co., must be hugely frustrated by the market’s favoring of Elon Musk and his upstart peers. Tesla has impressive software and battery technology, but others know how to build a decent electric vehicle now. Established carmakers are spending tens of billions of dollars on doing exactly this; they just aren’t very good at getting credit for it. Some environmentally focused investors refuse to ignore the fact that the incumbents still make lots of gas-guzzling SUVs. So perhaps the answer is for automakers to spin off their electric-vehicle activities to try to get the market to ascribe them Tesla-like valuations. It’s an approach that’s worked for utilities, which are gradually freeing their renewable-energy assets from the shackles of their legacy hydrocarbon businesses.GM and Volkswagen have both made massive bets on electric cars. Their battery technology is increasingly competitive and they’ve sought partners to build their own battery-cell plants, as Tesla has done with Panasonic.Their new vehicles are pretty eye-catching too. In the autumn, GM will launch an electric version of its hulking Hummer, which could give Tesla’s much-hyped Cybertruck some serious competition. Meanwhile, Volkswagen has just launched the ID.3 compact, the first vehicle built on its new “MEB” vehicle platform, which will be used as the base for its other mass-market electric models.(2) Volkswagen is licensing the platform to other carmakers, including Ford Motor Co., so it could become a money spinner. The German company will probably pass Tesla and become the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles in 2022, when it should sell more than a million battery-powered cars, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Rokossa.You can see why Rokossa and his American colleagues are urging GM and Volkswagen to separate their electric vehicle activities. This would help unlock value and maybe let the companies raise capital more easily. GM has already separated its Cruise autonomous-driving unit, helping it to raise billions of dollars from investors including SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Why not do similar with GM’s Ultium battery system and the GM vehicles that use it?Other industries upended by the energy transition are thinking along similar lines. German utility RWE AG’s shares have soared since it completed an asset swap with rival Eon SE that left it much more focused on generating clean electricity.(1) This week RWE took advantage of that high valuation by raising 2 billion euros of fresh capital. GM sounded somewhat open to the idea of a green spinoff on a recent investor call, although Volkswagen was more circumspect. In part, this reluctance is partly down to Europe’s environmental regulations. The legacy Volkswagen business needs to include electric vehicles to keep the average emissions of its fleet within European guidelines.Carmakers are also naturally wary of hiving off all of their most promising technology, such as electric batteries, for fear that investors might mark down the remaining ICE business as a “bad bank” — albeit a profitable one. How wise is it to chase Tesla’s nosebleed valuation anyway? It can’t be justified by any normal metric.Volkswagen’s complicated governance is another barrier to change. Minority shareholders’ take a backseat to the Porsche and Piech families, the State of Lower Saxony and the trade unions. I’ve written before about how the company’s luxury brands — Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti — might be worth as much as 100 billion euros if listed separately and valued like rival Ferrari NV. The people who call the shots at Volkswagen haven’t embraced the idea. A full separation of VW’s MEB business is probably unrealistic but even separate financial disclosure might help the valuation, says Rokossa.Still, there is something enticing about an electric spinoff, which might be good for shareholders and workers. Tesla has been able to raise more than $15 billion from supportive investors over the past decade, and it could probably raise another $5 billion tomorrow if it wanted. Volkswagen, meanwhile, must fund its electric investments — estimated at 30 billion euros over five years — mostly from its own cash flows, meaning there’s less money left over to pay employees. Perhaps if Tesla did weaponize its share price by raising another enormous chunk of cheap capital, that might convince rivals to think more creatively.(1) Audi and Porsche developed a separate electric platform for the luxury segment, called PPE.(2) Though RWE does still operate coal plants.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-08-19 07:00:31,Tesla or Nio: Which EV Company is Geared to Race Ahead?,TSLA,Yahoo,"The demand for electric vehicles (or EVs) is expected to grow in the long-term even as COVID-19 has currently disrupted the electric vehicle market and the whole automotive industry as well. Several countries are encouraging individuals to transition to electric vehicles to bring down toxic emissions and ensure sustainability.Cairn Energy Research Advisors estimate that global sales of electric cars will grow 36% in 2021 and will cross 3 million for the first time. Sam Jaffe, the research firm’s managing director, sees demand in China and Europe to be a major growth factor.Using the TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool, we will place Tesla—the market leader in the EV space, and China-based NIO alongside each other to see which stock offers the most compelling investment opportunity.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla garners a lot of attention from investors, analysts, and media owing to its rapid growth in the electric vehicle market and of course due to its controversial co-founder and CEO Elon Musk. Tesla stock has rallied about 339% year-to-date (as of August 17).Better-than-anticipated operational performance, a possible addition to the S&P 500, the prospects of development of the next-generation electric car batteries and favorable comments from bullish analysts are some reasons that drove the spectacular rise in the stock.Tesla’s second-quarter revenue declined 5% Y/Y to $6.04 billion but was way higher than analysts’ expectation of $5.37 billion. The company delivered adjusted EPS of $2.18 and GAAP EPS of $0.50, marking the fourth straight quarter of profitability. Skeptics questioned the company’s profitability and pointed out that it was possible because of the inclusion of higher-than-expected regulatory credits of $428 million.Regulatory credits or Zero-Emission Vehicles credits are given by state regulators to incentivize the production of electric vehicles. Tesla sells excess credits to other automakers so that they can comply with regulations. Tesla bears feel that the company is depending on such credits to deliver profits. As per Tesla, regulatory credit revenue might double this year compared to 2019 but will reduce over time.Meanwhile, Tesla’s second-quarter deliveries of 90,891 were down 4.7% Y/Y amid the pandemic but increased 2.7% compared to the first quarter. Despite the temporary shutdown of the Fremont factory due to COVID-19, the company reaffirmed its target to deliver 500,000 vehicles in 2020.Meanwhile, Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, launched in 2019, produces the company’s Model 3 vehicles for the customers in China. The company is building further production capacity through its factory in Berlin and the recently announced plant in Austin, Texas.On August 17 Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised his price target for Tesla to $1,900 from $1,800 based on strong demand in China. He stated, “Looking ahead, we believe Musk & Co. are slated to announce a number of new potential 'game-changing' battery developments at its highly anticipated Battery Day on Sept. 22.""The five-star analyst retained his Hold rating and is positive about the company’s price cuts driving further demand.  (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)Four Buys, 15 Holds and 9 Sell ratings for Tesla stock add up to a Hold consensus. After a stellar year-to-date rise, the average price target of $1,295 implies a possible downside of 29.45% in the stock over the next 12 months.Nio (NIO)Often touted as the Tesla of China, NIO is considered a pioneer in China’s premium electric vehicle market. The company, which has not yet turned profitable, was in the negative light in recent times due to its high cash burn rate and last year’s product recalls.However, the financial crisis was addressed with a cash infusion from strategic partners and $428 million raised through an ADR or American Depositary receipt offering.Nio reported better than anticipated second-quarter results. The company’s $0.16 loss per American Depositary Share (adjusted loss of $0.15) was lower than analysts’ loss estimate of $0.26. The second-quarter revenue of $526.4 million exceeded analysts’ forecast of $504 million. In terms of its local currency, the company’s revenue grew 146.5% to 3.72 billion yuan.The company delivered 10,331 ES6 and ES8 vehicles, a Y/Y jump of 191%. Nio also provided strong Q3 guidance with estimated deliveries between 11,000 to 11,500 vehicles.Nio also pleased investors by posting a gross margin of 8.4% compared to -33.4% in the prior year’s second quarter. Strong sales, lower material costs and improved manufacturing efficiency helped Nio deliver its first-ever positive gross margin. The quarter also marked the first instance of a positive operating cash flow for the company.Now Nio is focusing on ramping up production to meet higher demand and commence deliveries of its third vehicle, the EC6—a luxury crossover SUV, in September.So far Nio stock has advanced about 250% year-to-date as of August 17. However, an average 12-month price target of $10.28 indicates a downside of 26.83% in the stock. The Street’s Hold consensus for Nio stock is based on 2 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells.Following the results, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter increased his price target for Nio to $14 from $4 but maintained his Hold rating. In a research note, he stated ""NIO arguably relies too much on partners for core capabilities (especially self-driving systems, batteries, and vehicle manufacturing), but the company may attempt to internalize these functions over time.” (See NIO stock analysis on TipRanks)Tesla or Nio - the better choice?The rising competition in the electric vehicles space from giants like Ford and General Motors and start-ups like Nikola is a matter of concern. Also, Tesla’s high valuation makes it risky and has been a topic of debate. However, the company’s technology and a diversified business model, which includes its solar energy business, give it a competitive edge.Both Tesla and Nio stocks have skyrocketed this year and the Street’s average price targets do not indicate further upside. However, a more diversified business and better growth prospects appear to make Tesla a better long-term choice in the EV space compared to Nio.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

2020-08-19 12:30:00,GM to Double Down on China After Tesla Grabs Electric-Car Lead,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- General Motors Co. is accelerating its push into the fast-growing electric-car segment in China, the world’s largest market, seeking to challenge sales leader Tesla Inc. and a slew of local contenders.The Detroit-based carmaker outlined its technology rollout plan for electrification, intelligent driving and connectivity in China on Wednesday, including virtual presentations from executives including CEO Mary Barra and President of GM China, Julian Blissett.“As GM’s largest market and a global center of innovation, China will play a crucial role in making our vision a reality,” Barra said. “From 2020 to 2025, we will allocate more than $20 billion in capital and engineering resources to our EV and AV programs,” she said, referring to electric and autonomous vehicles.While GM’s sales have showed resilience in China amid the coronavirus pandemic, long-term growth prospects depend on its new models -- including electric cars -- attracting buyers. Demand for EVs is accelerating and Tesla has grabbed an early lead in Asia’s biggest economy after starting output from its new multibillion-dollar Shanghai plant.China’s car market is recovering from a two-year slump, helped by the reopening of showrooms, the receding of Covid-19 and an improving economy. Electric-vehicle sales growth eclipsed gas guzzlers last month following a year-long lull kicked off by the government scaling back EV subsidies.GM has said it plans to sell more than 20 EV models by around 2023. In March, the company unveiled a battery platform it is betting on to stand out from the competition.On Wednesday in Shanghai, GM gave more information about its new global EV platform, its Ultium battery system and its next-generation EVs for China.Highlights include:More than 40% of GM’s new launches in China over the next five years will be electrified models. They’ll be made in China, with almost all parts coming from local suppliersContinued rollout and upgrade of company’s Super Cruise driver-assistance system, to be featured on Cadillac’s lineup by mid-decade and expanded to Buick and Chevrolet modelsThe Cadillac Lyriq luxury all electric SUV will be available in China, aimed at wealthy customers. It will feature a glass roof and more spacious interior due to a new battery architectureFor 2021, an enhanced version of Super Cruise will be available in China and the U.S. with features including Lane Change on Demand, as well as richer map data. GM will offer Super Cruise on 20 vehicles globally by 2023GM will also accelerate the development of China-specific solutions for intelligent connected vehicles, with its first global vehicle-to-everything (V2X) program set for launch this year on the Buick GL8 vanAlmost all GM vehicles in China will be connected via flexible platforms; in 2022, 5G will be available on all new Cadillac models and most Chevrolet and Buick vehicles“GM has unmatched scale in leveraging big data and using our insights to deliver higher quality, more innovative and data-informed services to our customers,” Blissett said. “In the near future, we will make connectivity a standard feature in nearly all our global brand vehicles launched in China.”GM’s core business -- selling gasoline-powered sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks -- is generating cash but is viewed as being in long-term decline and is less exciting to investors than the company’s electric-car plans, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Emmanuel Rosner said in a note this week.While GM shares are down about 18% this year, makers of battery-powered cars have hit new heights. Shares of Tesla have soared to record levels, making the company the world’s most-valuable carmaker. Upstarts such as Nikola Corp., Fisker Inc. and Lordstown Motors Corp. have also seen gains.Meanwhile, Chinese EV contenders are accelerating their fundraising plans. Li Auto Inc. raised $1.1 billion in late July, and Xpeng Motors has plans for a $1 billion IPO. WM Motor Technology Co., meanwhile, is weighing an initial stock sale in Shanghai as soon as this year, people familiar with the matter said, and Hozon New Energy Automobile Co. is targeting a listing in the same city possibly next year.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."
2020-08-19 12:49:00,"Tesla&#39;s stock set to slip, which would snap best 5-day performance in 6 weeks",TSLA,Yahoo,"Shares of Tesla Inc.  were set to take a breather Wednesday after its recent rocket ride, in which the stock rose 37.3% amid a five-day win streak. The electric vehicle maker's stock slipped 0.9% in premarket trading, after closing Tuesday at a record $1,887.09, the third-straight record close. The current win streak was kicked off after Tesla announced a 5-for-1 stock split. As strong as the stock has been the past five days, it's only the best five-day percentage performance since the five-day stretch ended July 7, when the stock shot up 37.7%. And the five-day win streak is just the longest since the six-day stretch that ended July 7. Tesla's stock has more than doubled (up 133.6%) over the past three months through Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite  has rallied 22.1% and the S&P 500  has advanced 16.0%."

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), in its partnership with Panasonic Corporation (Pink: PCRFY), produces more batteries for the company's fleet of EVs than any other vehicle producer. Now it looks like that capacity will be expanded even further.A Wednesday report from Nikkei said that Panasonic is investing $100 million to increase the factory's battery production capacity.Tesla and Panasonic co-own and share Gigafactory Nevada, where most of Tesla's batteries are made. The investment will be made at this factory, which presently has 13 lines; the money will be used to add one additional line.This marks the first capacity increase since the factory was opened in 2017.Benzinga's Take: This news may be mentioned on Sept. 22 during Tesla's battery investor day. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said in the past that the company's biggest bottleneck will be battery production.Now it looks like the company is addressing that, as it also builds a new U.S.-based Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, which is expected to produce the Cybertruck, Model Y and Model 3.

2020-08-19 20:03:34,Tesla Denies Affiliation With Pinduoduo Group Model 3 Purchase In China,TSLA,Yahoo,"One part of Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) process that sets it apart from legacy automakers is the electric vehicle manufaturer's direct sales approach. Other cars are sold to a dealership, and customers must go through a dealership and deal with paperwork and overhead before purchasing.When buying a Tesla, a person can simply go online, build their car and click buy. The price is what's displayed, with no discounts or haggling. So when Chinese company Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: PDD) offered a group buy for up to 10,000 people for the made-in-China Tesla Model 3 last, it raised some red flags, according to the Tesmanian blog. Tesla China responded, alerting people that the action by Pinduoduo was unauthorized, even though Pinduoduo said Tesla was in on the group buy deal. The offer claimed savings of nearly $3,000 per purchase of the standard range plus Model 3.Tesla released another update Wednesday, after an employee from Pinduoduo tried to purchase a Model 3 and said they were denied for no reason.Tesla said they stopped the purchase because it was being made by the company, possibly for resale, and not the individual.Benzinga's Take: To anyone familiar with Tesla's sales model, the Pinduoduo sales sounds obviously unsanctioned by Tesla. The company is firm on its no-haggle sales model, with CEO Elon Musk claiming even he and his family pay full price for their vehicles.Photo courtesy of Tesla.

2020-08-19 21:06:27,Lucid Air&#39;s 300 Miles Of Range In 20 Minutes: The World&#39;s Fastest-Charging EV,TSLA,Yahoo,"A big concern for American motorists when considering an electric vehicle is where to charge it, and exactly how long is that charge going to take.While charging infrastructure is increasing in the U.S., the amount of time it takes to charge a vehicle can be problematic. While most owners can get a full charge overnight while sleeping, making multiple 20-minute or longer stops to charge on a long road trip can be inconvenient.Lucid's Game-Changing Specs: Lucid Motors said Wednesday that the company's efficient, 900-volt electric vehicle will boast charging times of up to 20 miles a minute, or 300 miles in just 20 minutes.Part of what makes this possible are the car's 350kW charging speeds on compatible charging infrastructure. This is 100kW faster than Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA) 250kW Supercharger network.Lucid also mentioned vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-vehicle charging hardware on the car, ready for future use.The production version of the Lucid Air is scheduled to debut in an online reveal on Sept. 9. Benzinga's Take: A faster charging speed for electric vehicles is positive. Although most owners leave home with a full battery of overnight charging, the spec is important for vacations or long days of driving without much time to charge.The Lucid Air must have a large battery, due to the fact that as a user approaches a high state of charge, the car must slow its charge rate to protect the battery.With a theoretical range of over 500 miles, this would put 300 miles at 60% battery capacity. Going from zero to 60% definitely seems possible, as Tesla claims similar charging speeds. Photo courtesy of Lucid Motors.

2020-08-28 23:23:07,Tesla targeted in failed ransomware extortion scheme,TSLA,https://www.ctpost.com,"BOSTON (AP) - In a tweet, Tesla CEO Elon Musk solved a mystery involving a 27-year-old Russian, an insider at an unnamed corporation and an alleged million-dollar payment offered to help trigger a ransomware extortion attack on the firm. 
 Prosecutors declined to name the target, but Musk was happy to oblige. According to the billionaire, the scheme took aim at the electric car company's 1.9 million-square-foot factory in Sparks, Nevada, which makes batteries for Tesla vehicles and energy storage units. 
 ""This was a serious attack,"" Musk tweeted Thursday night, responding to a Tesla blog post that detailed the brazen scheme. 
 Defendant Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov tried to recruit a fellow Russian speaker who worked at the plant, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada. 
 Reaching out to the unnamed worker via WhatsApp in July, Kriuchkov allegedly flew to the United States with a Russian passport on a tourist visa and sought to entice the worker to betray Tesla. Kriuchkov allegedly took the worker, who he'd he'd first met in 2016, on a road trip to Lake Tahoe before offering the person $1 million to plant malware on computer systems at ""Victim Company A."" Kriuchkov floated the scheme at a Reno area bar on Aug. 3 after the two drank heavily until last call, the complaint says. 
 But the plant worker informed Tesla, which contacted the FBI and won the employee's cooperation. In subsequent meetings monitored and recorded by federal agents, Kriuchkov laid out a scheme to have the worker infect Tesla computers with a program that would steal valuable data before scrambling plant systems with ransomware, according to the complaint. 
 Kriuchkov was quoted as saying the inside job would be camouflaged with a distributed denial of service attack on plant computers from outside. Such..."

2020-10-28 20:00:35,New EPA Data Shows Tesla Excels In Electric Vehicle Efficiency,TSLA,Yahoo,"One of the most important aspects of an electric car is efficiency. Only so much battery energy can fit in the space a vehicle allows, and the batteries can be expensive. A more efficient car can go farther with a smaller battery.The newest EPA data for 2021 Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) vehicles shows the company is still firmly in the lead when it comes to efficiency. It's one of the reasons Teslas have the best range of any electric cars on the planet. Electrek has done a comparison with some other brands, and Tesla is far ahead of the competition.The EPA lists how much energy -- in kilowatt-hours -- it takes for an electric vehicle to go 100 miles.Tesla's AWD Model 3 uses 25kWh to go 100 miles, while the two-door Mini Cooper SE, a much smaller vehicle, uses 31kWh for the same distance. This is approximately 25% more energy to go the same distance in a much smaller car. Benzinga's Take: Tesla's efficiency is impressive. Even the company's crossover Model Y uses less energy per mile than the much smaller Mini Cooper.The efficiencies presented by Tesla allow lower vehicle costs, more range and a savings for customers when it comes time to charge their cars as well.

Tesla claims it also offers a ""more responsive and faster touchscreen experience.""Adding Radio to the upgrade will cost the owners of these earlier models a total of $3,000 (plus applicable tax). ""There is no difference in price if you have the Radio Upgrade and Infotainment Upgrade installed separately or together,"" the company says.Radio upgrades will become available in the current quarter.Why It Matters: The decision to offer the radio retrofit came after complaints from some owners, Electrek reported.The new entertainment features have reportedly led to an increased demand for the infotainment updates.Radio service from Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: SIRI) will only be available on vehicles with existing XM radio antennas and requires an additional subscription. AM radio will not be available even with the upgrade, Tesla said on its website.In June, it was reported that the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is probing the failure of Tesla's giant touch screens that took place between 2012 and 2015.Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 4.4% lower at $406.02 on Wednesday and gained 0.37% in the after-hours session.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Trump Campaign Website Hacked, Attackers Demand Cryptocurrency In Exchange For Spilling Secrets  * Tesla Reports Improved Miles-To-Accidents Ratio For Autopilot(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-10-29 09:00:00,Crypto Exchange FTX to Trade Top Stocks From Tesla to Amazon,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- Cryptocurrency traders will soon be able to trade tokenized shares of some of the world’s largest companies like Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Crypto exchange FTX, in partnership with German financial firm CM Equity AG and Swiss-based Digital Assets AG, is offering what they call fractional stocks -- about a dozen stock and crypto pairs that will be traded on FTX’s platform -- according to a press release seen by Bloomberg. Other notable names include Facebook Inc., Netflix Inc., Tesla Inc. and the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund.The move is part of a wider push in the cryptocurrency industry to popularize securitized token listings, digital assets that have been marketed for otherwise illiquid holdings such as real estate to art. Institutional interest in the crypto space has grown this year with Bitcoin almost tripling in value since March to hit the highest levels since January 2018.Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, said the tokens are targeted at investors who find it difficult or inconvenient to access stocks through traditional markets.“For a lot of people it’s a hassle” to access stocks, he said in an interview. “There are ways to do it but they feel very much old and clunky. Giving people access broadens out what you can trade.”The tokens will behave much like a depositary receipt or ETF, Bankman-Fried said. Investors can trade the tokens on FTX but will need to cash them out for the underlying security via CM Equity, which holds the actual securities, he said.There are trading fees for the service but no other management fees for holding the tokens, a spokeswoman with FTX said. Registration begins Thursday and trading will go live shortly after.

This has actually come after lackluster returns for the past two decades. But everything has changed suddenly in 2020, with PLUG stock going from $3.80 to $15. The market capitalization is now at $6 billion.

But a few days after the election, the company, which is a top player in the hydrogen fuel cell market, will report its third quarter results. And yes, Wall Street is quite bullish on expectations.
The consensus is for a spike in revenues by 80% to $110 million. As for the bottom line, the earnings per share is expected to come in with a loss of 7 cents a share.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Keep in mind that the Covid-19 pandemic has not slowed down Plug Power. Just look at some of the highlights of the quarter:
The company announced that it has expanded its GenDrive product line. There are now three more fuel cell solutions that are targeted for European industrial and material handling vehicles. Note that Europe has been a nice source of growth for the company.
The company signed a memorandum of understanding with Linde (NYSE:LIN) for Plug Power’s ProGen fuel cell, which includes the Class 6 and Class 8 vehicles. The vehicles are expected to be on the road early next year.
The company announced a partnership with Apex Clean Energy, which is a leader in utility-scale wind and solar power facilities. Both companies will explore ways to promote green hydrogen in the U.S.
Plug Power issued 30.7 million shares in a secondary offering. The stock price was $10.25.
The company announced a new 1K ProGen fuel cell system for robots, drones and other aerospace applications. This has come as a result of the acquisition of EnergyOr.
The Big Picture
I’ve been bullish on PLUG stock for some time. The main reason: the long-term prospects look extremely favorable. As seen with the huge success of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), there is substantial demand for alternative energy approaches.  The sentiment is quickly becoming mainstream.
Now it’s true that the use of hydrogen fuel cells has its downsides. The costs are still high and there have been challenges with adoption. There will also need to be heavy investments in infrastructure.
But despite all this, there continue to be great strides in improving hydrogen cells. For example, according to a study from McKinsey: “By scaling up across sectors, hydrogen demand in the U.S. could reach 17 million metric tons by 2030 and 63 million metric tons by 2050, roughly equivalent to 14 percent of energy demand.”
If this prediction pans out, then Plug Power will be in an ideal position. The company has the advantages of scale and an extensive platform of systems and technologies. There is also a customer list that includes biggies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Kroger (NYSE:KR), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Another essential part of the strategy has been to focus on the materials handling market. This requires an energy source for long-range transportation.
And finally, the company has been smart to pursue an aggressive M&A strategy. Deals for companies like United Hydrogen and Giner ELX have expanded the product line and opened up new market opportunities.

Bottom Line On PLUG Stock
While the long-term prospects look positives, investors may still want to get a better price point on PLUG stock. The election is likely to stir up more volatility – and this could put lots of pressure on growth stocks. Let’s face it, there’s a chance that it could take a while to determine who will win.
And even if there is a slight miss for Q3 earnings, this will mean even more selling. So for now, it’s probably best to wait on PLUG stock.

While so many other investments have fully bounced back from their novel coronavirus funk in March, GE stock has not. At $7.37 per share, it has slashed close to three quarters of its value in five years. That once fortress-like dividend? Reduced to rubble.
Yet whatever has befallen the company these last few years, there’s an interesting percolation among Wall Street analysts. At this point, a dozen call GE a buy. Yes, seven call it a hold. But no one, not a single one, has labeled it a sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

GE Stock and the New-Found Optimism
GE is actually overweight. And dumping stubborn negativity for solid possibility, GE clobbered analyst expectations Wednesday when it reported adjusted third-quarter earnings per share of 6 cents versus a loss of 4 cents.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

Thus in four of the last five quarters, GE has beaten the street while retaining a nifty price-earnings ratio just under 19. That’s right about where most investors will want their holdings to fall, and it’s certainly more favorable than perennial favorites such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at 33 or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) at a death-defying 817. Price to earnings tells you how much you’ll pay in dollars to buy into a dollar of company earnings.
Thus, the analyst optimism is grounded in performance. But watch me as I steal away the punchbowl: That’s recent performance. In between all the good news, the second quarter of 2020 saw GE stock lose 15 cents per share and miss analyst expectations by 5 cents. It’s fair to ask whether this potential comeback is a transitory moment as opposed to transitional movement.
Financial Woes Remain
As recently as a month ago, GE stock held all the appeal for me of walking barefoot across a factory floor of smashed light bulbs. And over the last few years, GE has been savaged to such a degree that blowing off certain headline stories — such as the company slashing its once-legendary dividend to just a penny effective December 2018 – cannot and must not be ignored. It hasn’t boosted it since.

Meanwhile, the pension woes impacting GE stock are well documented. So are its troubles with covering long-term care insurance policies out of its insurance business unit. And the worst thing a company on the ropes needs is a highly publicized fraud allegation, which came last year.
Harry Markopolos — the whistleblower who revealed Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme — released a scathing 175-page report in August 2019 that alleged financial manipulations amounting to “a bigger fraud than Enron.”
Extra Innings Needed Before Buying
If nothing else, Wednesday’s earnings beat suggests that now may be a good time to buy GE stock. It offers one more piece of compelling evidence that the company is in rebound mode. Culp for his own part is realistic: “If we were playing a little bit of baseball, I think we’re probably in the second or third inning” of the comeback, he said on Oct. 26.
Fine metaphor that this is, it depends on what kind of contest we’re talking about. Id it game four of the World Series with GE down three games to one? Or Opening Day in a brand-new season?
It may be somewhere in between. Culp is a respected CEO. But with respect to my portfolio, I don’t see GE showing enough signs of leaving its troubles behind. I’d love to see a dividend increase, resolution of the pension woes and definitive, reassuring answers to Markopolos’ allegations. Once any or all of that transpires, maybe I’ll join Team Culp and take a swing for the fences.

When its merger deal was announced back in August, these shares, formerly known as DPHC stock, soared. They went from around $10 per share to as high as $31.80.

But, in the weeks since the stock reached that high, the “EV bubble” has taken a breather. RIDE stock, along with other names vying to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA,) have headed lower. Development-stage EV companies like Lordstown may offer massive long-term potential. Yet the pressure’s on for them to deliver.
Can Lordstown live up to its still-high expectations? All bets are off. On one hand, the company’s flagship Endurance EV truck may have enough factors on its side to ensure that it’s a winner right out of the gate.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
On the other hand, the company has its work cut out for it. Sure, since it’s using a former General Motors (NYSE:GM) plant for its manufacturing operations, its long-term infrastructure needs have already been met. But if the company fails to turn the initial interest in Endurance into consistently strong sales, Lordstown could wind up having excess capacity.
So as the stock heads closer to the  offering price of around $10 per share, what should investors do with it? RIDE stock remains a high-risk but high-potential opportunity.  As the shares pull back,  now is the time to consider entering a long-term position in the name.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

The Near-Term Outlook of  RIDE Stock
It’s no surprise that the closing of Lordstown’s merger with  DiamondPeak, a SPAC, hasn’t fueled a rebound by this stock. While SPAC stocks, EV stocks, and SPAC stocks with EV catalysts were “too hot to touch” earlier this year, the speculation that lifted these stocks has started to taper off.
That being said, the party may not be over yet for SPAC EV plays, including RIDE stock. As InvestorPlace’s Sarah Smith reported on Oct. 27, there’s a major catalyst just around the corner that could fuel a second wave of “EV mania:” next week’s U.S. Presidential elections.

If former Vice President Joe Biden wins the White House, we could see large investments by the federal government  in “green” initiatives. That could help drive another near-term rally by Lordstown Motors and other major EV stocks.
Sure, it may not be worth chasing RIDE stock now, in an effort to benefit from a quick short-term pop. But Biden’s push for clean energy could fuel long-term demand for EVs by governments. And, since Lordstown’s focus is on EV trucks for the fleet market, demand from federal, state, and municipal agencies for its vehicle could be strong.
But consider this a secondary long-term catalyst. More important factors remain in motion, which in tandem could drive this stock significantly higher in the coming years.
The Long-Term Bull Case for Lordstown Remains Intact
Earlier this month, I laid out how RIDE stock has all the ingredients to become a long-term winner. First, with 40,000 pre-orders for the Endurance, there’s more than sufficient demand for the commercial EV truck.
Secondly, with fuel costs a major pain point among the owners of commercial fleets, the shift to EVs could happen sooner in this market than in passenger vehicles. Thirdly, as I mentioned above, Lordstown has the infrastructure to become a major EV manufacturer.
Thanks to its purchase of the former GM plant in Lordstown, OH, the company claims it has the capacity to produce up to 600,000 vehicles per year. With the Endurance sporting a sticker price of $52,000, this could mean potential revenue of well over $30 billion, on par with Tesla’s sales today.
But before you rush out and buy RIDE stock, keep a few things in mind. Namely, the company isn’t set to deliver vehicles until the second half of 2021. While  that’s not very far away, a lot could change in the meantime.
As InvestorPlace columnist Joel Bagole noted in his Oct. 20 article, since the company has yet to manufacture vehicles, who’s to say there won’t be issues when the Endurance starts rolling off the assembly lines? Any sort of manufacturing hiccup or delay could shatter confidence in this company’s ambitions, quickly sending Lordstown’s shares down to the single digits.
Don’t Throw in the Towel, But Tread Carefully
Sure, investor mania over EV stocks is starting to fade. But with Lordstown’s compelling prospects and its tremendous potential to become a major EV maker, it’s premature to throw out this baby with the bathwater.
This development-stage EV company still has much to prove. But, with multiple factors on its side, Lordstown has a better shot than many of its rivals to become the “next Tesla.”
So, what’s the play now? While this remains a solid opportunity, don’t go hog-wild. Consider RIDE stock a cautious buy as its shares pull back.

2020-10-30 14:17:56,Increased Uncertainty Presents A Huge Opportunity For Sunrun Stock,TSLA,Yahoo,"Amid a seasonally spooky October following a stellar quarterly run, is Sunrun (NYSE:RUN) worth buying today? Let’s see what’s happening off and on the price chart for RUN stock, then propose a stronger, risk-adjusted determination for investors.

RUN shareholders enjoyed a sizzling (if not dizzying) rally this summer and into the fall. From July up to a peak and all-time-high share price of $82.42 on October 1, Sunrun soared higher by just over 175%.
Not bad, right? It’s absolutely true, especially compared to solid broader market gains on either side of 10% for the quarter.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Behind the unusually strong rally in RUN shares, it’s fairly common knowledge the solar industry has become a hot play in 2020. Along with alternative energy plays ranging from the largest of the large like EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to more speculative hydrogen outfits such as Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), this expansive and diverse market has increasingly felt the love from Wall Street on the back of expectations of a Democratic White House and in-tow ‘greener’ energy initiatives.


					7 Cutting-Edge Biotech Stocks for Tomorrow 				

Still, Sunrun’s stock performance stood out as an early achiever in the space.
Shares outpaced the Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN) by almost three-to-one over for the quarter ending in September. RUN also crushed enviable rallies in heavily-traded peers First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR), SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG), Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) and many others. So what’s the deal?
The jumpstart RUN experienced could be attributed to the company’s announced buyout of rival Vivint Solar followed by the Justice Department’s ‘early termination’ of an antitrust waiting period. The deal combines the market’s two largest residential solar installers into one massive renewable energy giant. Cost synergies estimated at around $90 million may have been another factor at play, as Sunrun’s sales and marketing costs have been trending higher since 2017.
The Motley Fool theorizes investors may have partly bid shares up on Sunrun’s increased investment into virtual power plants. In a nutshell, as RUN introduces more energy storage systems it can combine and bid the platforms into competitive power markets. It’s potentially another revenue stream for the company’s thousands of installations each year.
October has been a different and more frightening story for many RUN investors though. The good news in this strategist’s estimation, the price action is actually less scary and resembles what happens consistently to even the best stocks.

RUN Stock Daily Price Chart

The fact is, all stocks correct. And those odds increase after sizable rallies. Even in healthy market environments, profit-taking will eventually make its mark on the price chart.
Technically, considering RUN stock’s October stumble of 36%, the loss in valuation is standard fare for a volatile stock of Sunrun’s caliber. Losses on either side of 30% during risk-on trading environments are routine. And in less benign market cycles, corrective declines of 40% and even 50% aren’t uncommon while the broader market peels off 5% to 10%.
It is what it is. And with the likes of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite giving back 4% to 6% in September and roughly 1% to 2% in October, without oversimplifying matters, it’s likely as simple as that. Looking forward though, buying in the aftermath of RUN’s correction and today’s bullishly-oversold and well-supported candlestick signal is slightly more challenging.
There is next week’s election to consider. It nearly goes without saying the Presidency is going to a contested and drawn out event. Sunrun also has earnings. That raises the bar on uncertainty as a lot of moving parts beyond one or two numbers goes into how investors react to any given quarterly report. I’ll leave it at that, well almost.
Among other expectations, Wall Street’s analyst community is forecasting 2 cents per share on sales of $209 million from Sunrun when it reports November 6. More importantly, investors should be braced for significant gap risk which works both ways. And the way I see it, given where RUN has been, is right now on the price chart and potentially how things may or may not take shape going into the new year, the January $60 / $65 bull call spread looks about right when weighing the risks versus the potential rewards.

GM is backing the start-up, which merged with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) called DiamondPeak to go public this week.
It’s all part of a frenzy of electric-car financing, as investors continue to reject the old gas-powered giants and search for someone who might compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) went public earlier and is now part-owned by GM. A company called Fisker is also trying to go public through a SPAC.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
What Lordstown Has to Offer
Lordstown has a design for an electric truck that looks more like a standard model than the Tesla Cybertruck, which is made out of thick sheet metal that doesn’t bend easily.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

The plan is to get the new truck into production by next September. Meanwhile a prototype is doing stunts against Ford (NYSE:F) F-150s.
CEO Steve Burns says that what will distinguish his truck, called the Endurance, is its price. At $45,000 it’s directly price-competitive with gas-powered models from GM and Ford.
The company is targeted at large fleet-buyers, claiming the Endurance gets the equivalent of 75 miles per gallon of fuel. Burns says 40,000 units have been pre-ordered, worth $1.4 billion. Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, an Ohio native, has been signed as spokesman for the truck.
David Hamamoto, the man behind DiamondPeak, is a former real estate executive whose NorthStar real estate empire had merged in 2016. Hamamoto resigned from it in 2017. He is also a former executive with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).  DiamondPeak was formed in 2019 specifically to merge with a private company like Lordstown.
Differing Views
InvestorPlace writers hold different opinions about the new company.

Louis Navillier loves it. He likes the market and notes that those who bought DiamondPeak shares before the merger saw them rise, at one point, to over $30 each. He noted that the merger brings Lordstown $675 million in cash to get Endurance into production.
Alex Sirois is more skeptical. He likes the fleet vertical because it means Lordstown doesn’t have to build a dealer network. But he notes that reservations to buy the truck cost just $100, so it’s a deal people can get out of. He also notes that fleet sales are a very competitive business. It’s an important niche for both GM and Ford.
My Best Guess
I suspect that all these start-ups — Nikola, Lordstown and Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) — are actually stalking horses in Detroit’s effort to catch Tesla.
Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Wall Street has turned thumbs down on Detroit’s plans for electrics, but it seems to love electric vehicle start-ups. The combined value of all three companies comes to about $13 billion. This means Detroit can afford to buy them out, and GM already has a deal in place with Nikola, which is the most valuable of the three.
But for all the speculation around support from President Donald Trump’s administration, or the possibility of a U.S. Postal Service contract, Tesla remains the 800-pound elephant in the space.
Tesla is now to these start-ups what GM was to Tesla just a few years ago. Tesla is scaled. It has the brand name, and it has the market.
If Lordstown can get trucks out the door, the best thing for it might be to be bought by one of the Detroit companies. The ceiling, in short, is limited.

At its highs, Tesla stock commanded a market capitalization in excess of $450 billion. That made it one of the largest stocks in the entire market. Think about that for a minute: The company that seemingly everyone hated became one of the most valuable entities in the country.
From its low on Aug. 11 to its high on Sept. 1, TSLA stock surged more than 70%. Admittedly, that was a bit exuberant — particularly given its market cap at that point — as the rally was being driven by momentum ahead of its stock split.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
However, the latest quarter highlights why the stock has had momentum.
Earnings, Deliveries Beat
Earlier this month on Oct. 2, Tesla reported third-quarter deliveries of 139,300 vehicles. More than 124,000 of those vehicles were the Model 3 or Model Y. This result was able to top consensus Wall Street expectations of 137,000 and crushed its previous deliveries record of 112,000.


					7 Coronavirus Stocks to Buy for the Second Wave				

A few weeks later, the company impressed again. Non-GAAP earnings of 76 cents per share beat estimates by 16 cents. On a GAAP basis, Tesla also turned in a profitable quarter, its fifth straight quarterly net income.
Additionally, revenue of $8.77 billion grew almost 40% year over year and beat estimates by a good amount. Can we talk about that for a minute? At a time where the global economy is getting thrashed, Tesla found a way to generate 40% revenue growth and churn out record deliveries.
Talk about impressive.
Even better, automotive margins climbed to 27.7% in the quarter. That was up from 25.4% sequentially and easily beat analysts’ expectations of 24.1%. Versus the same quarter a year ago, Tesla’s automotive gross margins increased significantly from 22.8%.
Breaking Down TSLA Stock
We’ve talked about deliveries and vehicles, but notice that I haven’t yet called Tesla an automaker. That’s because I consider Tesla a tech company with an automotive business unit. That’s as Tesla continues to make progress on the autonomous driving front and also has an energy unit. 
Moreover, Tesla continues to deploy systems as it works on its solar roof approach. In fact, the company said, (bold emphasis added):
“Our energy storage business reached record deployments of 759 MWh in Q3. Megapack production continued to ramp at Gigafactory Nevada as production volumes more than doubled in Q3. 
Powerwall demand remains strong and is growing, particularly as our solar business grows as many customers include a Powerwall with their solar installation. Additionally, we are seeing accelerating interest in Powerwall as concerns with grid stability grow, particularly in California. We continue to believe that the energy business will ultimately be as large as our vehicle business.“

You see, the energy unit of Tesla has huge potential as consumers, municipalities, states and entire countries start to alter the way they view energy consumption. The world is making an enormous shift to green energy, and Tesla is in prime position to leverage that shift. 
However, the company is also properly preparing for the future — like any great company with a visionary CEO. And despite doubts aplenty regarding Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, the factory went up in impressive time. 
Now, Tesla is working on factories in Germany and Texas, as it gears up for the Cybertruck, Roadster and Semi. Regarding the German factory, Tesla expects production to start next year. 
To get these jobs done, Tesla raised an additional $5 billion in cash in September. Some investors may not like the dilution, but honestly, I love it. A company like Tesla needs capital, particularly when liquidity was the bears’ strongest argument. And with CEO Elon Musk owning tons of the stock and plenty of long-term investors in the name, why not raise funds?
In fact, Bank of America analysts argue that Tesla should raise even more capital. Last quarter, it ended with more than $14.5 billion in cash and equivalents and had positive operating cash flow. 
Volatility Is Your Friend
Click to EnlargeSource: Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com
Last but not least, volatility is our friend. TSLA stock goes through its ebbs and flows — like any other stock. It will not go up forever, so enjoy the sunshine as it bakes down upon us. 
After spending a few years in a sideways trading pattern, Tesla stock is up more than 500% in the past year. Amid that pattern, bulls had plenty of days to rejoice and plenty of days spent tending their wounds. 
Now, they need to remember that the painful stretches are an opportunity to buy. Those who bought the deep dips in TSLA stock have reaped handsome rewards. And I don’t expect that to change going forward.

Fiat Chrysler had already reached an agreement to pool its fleet with Tesla’s.European Union rules that took effect this year force manufacturers to reduce the average emissions of the fleet of cars they sell in the region to 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer, or face hefty fines. As a result, companies have been introducing new plug-in hybrid and fully electric models, and those that are at risk of falling short of compliance have paired up with peers who are better positioned.Last week, Volvo Cars announced it will overachieve in meeting the regulations and allow Ford Motor Co. to pool with its fleet for an undisclosed sum. Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley told analysts last week that the company was locked into an agreement to pay Tesla through next year for its help meeting emissions standards.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

A win by Trump could give the automakers more years to boost their infrastructure and production for electric vehicles.The Detroit News reports General Motors plans to invest $20 billion on electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles through 2025. Ford plans on investing $11 billion on electric vehicles by 2022.Trump has been hesitant to award tax credits for people to purchase electric vehicles.

This is in contrast to the 281,849 road traffic accidents actually reported. ""In the Tesla world, it is easy to verify that these vehicles have no defects in their technology via the internet. So [it's] theoretically feasible,"" Dudenhoffer said. Benzinga's Take: Data from Tesla shows that the same Tesla vehicles with autopilot enabled have far fewer accidents per mile. Now an outside researcher is finding this technology could improve the safety of drivers if all cars had the same sensors equipped. European competition does not have as advanced of systems, although Musk has mentioned that Tesla is open to licensing the tech.

2020-11-02 21:00:00,Magic Johnson Selling Gels Shows U.S. Brands Flocking to Alibaba,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg) -- For American brands struggling to survive the resurgent coronavirus, China is proving to be one of the few bright spots. As Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. prepares to host its biggest and most global shopping marathon ever, its position as a gateway to the world’s fastest-recovering economy is winning points with an increasingly hostile U.S. administration.Alibaba’s Singles’ Day event culminates annually Nov. 11, an online shopping phenomenon that with $38 billion of sales in 2019 easily dwarfed Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The festivities, which provide a snapshot of Chinese consumption, will feature the largest international presence since the company pioneered the format 11 years ago, including a number of U.S. merchants making their first forays into the Asian market.One such company, Uncle Bud’s, is targeting at least 1 million yuan ($150,000) of sales, all through its online store on Alibaba’s Tmall Global platform. The Los Angeles-based personal care goods maker has roped in former NBA superstar Magic Johnson to hawk its hemp and cannabis-based products like body gels and lotions to Chinese shoppers in a livestream ahead of Single’s Day.“Tmall really embraces finding brands that are emerging and bringing them to Chinese consumers,” Uncle Bud’s co-founder Bruno Schiavi said in an interview. “We wanted to have a big powerful company behind us. As an emerging brand from the U.S. to the China market, there are always many steps. But having Tmall behind you, to us that’s fantastic.”China’s largest annual online shopping fiesta is only the flashiest example of how American consumer brands have increasingly come to rely on the world’s No. 2 economy for growth. For them, Alibaba affords one of the biggest windows into China’s rising middle class -- American merchants commanded the second-highest sales after Japanese among importers in 2019’s edition. That’s especially true this year, with companies like Estée Lauder Cos. and Nike Inc. banking on the Chinese consumer to help recoup some of the sales lost in the pandemic-induced global economic slowdown.That fact is likely not lost on Washington. The online retail giant’s domestic focus -- international commerce accounts for just 7% of total sales -- means the company has limited access to potentially sensitive personal data, unlike fellow Chinese internet giants ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.Donald Trump has attempted to ban ByteDance’s TikTok and the WeChat super-app, owned by Tencent, in the runup to the presidential elections and he may be emboldened by a second term to continue decoupling Washington from Beijing. Even if Trump loses in Tuesday’s election, a Biden presidency will likely not lead to a strategy overhaul, with the Democratic candidate shifting toward a more confrontational tone toward China over the past few years.Read more: This Is What Biden Has Said on Major U.S. Flashpoints With ChinaMany Americans will not have heard of Singles’ Day, a uniquely Chinese antidote to the sentimentality surrounding Valentine’s Day. Originating in college campuses across the country, it takes its name from the way the date is written numerically as 11/11, which resembles “bare branches,” a local expression for the unattached.This year, the promotional blitz has been expanded, with pre-sales starting on Oct. 21. U.S. merchants such as Nike, Apple Inc. and Estée Lauder were among 100 brands that achieved revenue of at least 100 million yuan in the first 111 minutes after sales promos commenced Nov. 1, Alibaba said.More than 2,600 new foreign brands will be featured on Tmall Global for the first time ever in 2020. Earlier this year, the company held its inaugural Go Global 11.11 Pitch Fest offering American merchants that have no physical operations in China a chance to be spotlighted during the event. Uncle Bud’s emerged as one of the winners, alongside eight other companies that will bring a range of products from vegan face creams to purple hairdye and drinking vinegars to the Chinese market for the first time.Alibaba is hoping its growing role as middleman to global merchants can help revive flagging growth. Its revenue is expected on average to increase 31% in the September quarter, the slowest pace on record for the period. The company is set to report results on Thursday.Read more: Trump Adds to Earnings Threat as Alibaba Challenged in China“For certain categories, like cosmetics, apparel and electronics, if you want to win in China, you have to win e-commerce,” said Jonathan Cheng, partner and head of China retail at Bain & Co. “And if you want to win e-commerce, you have to work with the leaders.”Nearly 800 million annual active shoppers frequent Alibaba’s wide array of platforms, ranging from the Ebay-style Taobao site to Amazon-like Tmall and grocery service Freshippo. That’s helped the company turn itself into Asia’s largest -- one that’s on its way to joining the trillion-dollar club. But its pole position is being challenged on multiple fronts. Upstart Pinduoduo Inc. is offering cheaper bargains, JD.com Inc. has expanded beyond its traditional strength in consumer electronics, while Tencent-backed Meituan is engaged in a fierce battle with Alibaba’s Ele.me food delivery app.While its core commerce business -- which accounted for 87% of revenue in the June quarter -- has been relatively unscathed by U.S.-China tensions, it is in cloud computing where Alibaba faces the most direct threat from the White house. As part of Trump’s broader campaign to prevent Chinese companies from accessing the private data of Americans, the so-called Clean Network Initiative unveiled by U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo sought to stop U.S. firms from using cloud computing services offered by Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu Inc.More recently, people within the Trump administration are said to be exploring potential restrictions on Alibaba affiliate Ant Group, though that hasn’t dented enthusiasm for the fintech giant’s blockbuster IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai.Still, Alibaba executives have repeatedly touted their role in connecting American merchants like Uncle Bud’s with Chinese buyers. “As the world’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba’s primary commercial focus in the U.S. is to support our American brands, retailers, small businesses and the farmers to sell to consumers and the trade partners in China,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said in August.Read more: Alibaba Appeals to Trump, Says it Supports U.S. BusinessesIt’s this function that may give the next U.S. administration pause when it comes to Alibaba, said Paul Triolo, a former U.S. government official who specializes in global technology policy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group.“There is no indication that the U.S. government wants to go after Alibaba’s Taobao platform in the U.S., which targets small and medium sized US companies to allow them to access the China market,” Triolo said. Some politicians on Capitol Hill are “concerned about the market impact of any attempt to go after a large consumer-facing Chinese platform,” he added.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s long-term growth could be propelled by the company’s multi-pronged strategy to broaden its global presence beyond near-term geopolitical pressures. It’s capitalizing on worldwide consumption through export platform AliExpress, China import demand via Tmall Global, and pushing directly into local markets through subsidiaries such as Lazada.\-- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the researchFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

It is unknown how much money Honda is paying Tesla, but Tesla has made over $1.2 billion so far this year off regulatory credits from other manufacturers.In an interview with CNBC, a former Tesla board member was quoted as saying ""Tesla is eating the competitor's lunch, and having them pay for it.""Benzinga's Take: This is great news for Tesla. More credits means more profit.Although the regulatory credits leading to record earnings have been a point of contention, the amounts keep increasing every year. Tesla already has a huge lead in electric vehicle technology, and the competition is essentially paying them to keep that lead strong. Tesla is essentially converting legacy automaker's pollution into new clean technology.

The company has to leverage its strengths and scale, which makes them strategic about the chosen platforms.Why It Matters: Ford's Mach-E has its own platform designed from the ground up to be a battery-electric vehicle, but Ford trucks and commercial vehicles will be built on platforms they share with the internal combustion engine models to achieve scale, Lawler said.Lawler also added that Ford has an alliance with Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) for battery-electric commercial vehicles in Europe to benefit from their scale.Ford is taking on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) with its Mach-E vehicle. CEO Jim Farley, in a separate interview with the DFP, said that Mach-E is the first real competitor with Tesla.

2020-11-03 14:45:20,Understanding Tesla&#39;s Unusual Options Activity,TSLA,Yahoo,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $400.51.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-11-06  * Strike Price: $450.00  * Volume: 7345  * Open Interest: 7893Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being ""out of the money"". This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For October 22, 2020  * Tesla's Debt Overview(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Musk described the time period as ""production [and] logistics hell.""""I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla,"" the billionaire entrepreneur said in a tweet.Musk said it was ""extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup"" at a time when competitors like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Chrysler, now known as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE: FCAU), were going bankrupt.The Tesla CEO also talked about his executive pay package that includes stock options when he meets certain benchmarks. ""The reason for the stock options is that they're needed to help pay for humanity to get to Mars in 10 to 20 years,"" Musk said, referring to SpaceX and its ambitions with the red planet. Why It Matters: The Palo Alto-based automaker has come a long way since the challenging days Musk described in his tweets, with the Model 3  emerging as the most popular EV in the world this year.The model dominated the Chinese markets this summer -- with 11,014 units sold in July in the country. At the beginning of the year, Tesla started producing the Model 3 at its Shanghai Gigafactory and the main structure of the second phase of that facility meant to produce Model Y is also now complete.The automaker began exporting China-made Model 3 vehicles to more than 10 European countries including Germany, France, and Switzerland last month.Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 5.8% higher at $423.90 on Tuesday and gained 0.17% in the after-hours session.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Tesla FSD Beta Is Next Rolling Out In Canada, Norway, Musk Says  * Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Survives Elliott Ax As Company Offers Concessions(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-04 13:06:14,A Ferrari May Be Less Polluting Than You Think,TSLA,Yahoo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Which pollutes the most: a 1.5-liter Volkswagen Golf or a Ferrari 812 GTS with a 12-cylinder engine?Most people would say the Ferrari, but the correct answer is more nuanced, according to the Italian sportscar manufacturer. Its boss, Louis Camilleri, says it depends on how much you drive it.During an investor call this week, Camilleri took issue with European environmental regulations that aim to cut transport emissions by penalizing the sale of vehicles with particularly thirsty engines. “If you take a V12 Ferrari that only runs 3,000 kilometers a year, probably it has less emissions than a very small car that runs every day,” he said. The car industry needs to do a better job of educating regulators, he added.You can see where Camilleri’s coming from. Ferrari’s wealthy customers often own several of its sportscars, which they treat as prized works of art rather than runabouts. From a climate perspective, what matters is the total volume of carbon spewed into the atmosphere.Still, I think this is one battle Ferrari is destined to lose. Governments are rightly clamping down on carmakers’ carbon emissions to prevent catastrophic climate change. The earsplitting growl of a Ferrari engine is a potent symbol, even if it isn’t the primary problem.Camilleri shouldn’t lose heart, however. Selling electric vehicles could boost Ferrari’s already stratospheric profit margins, and catalyze a wider industry shift away from polluting fuels.Until recently Ferrari had little cause for environmental complaint. A low-volume car producer, it isn’t subject to the same stringent rules — starting this year — that tell European manufacturers to not exceed an average of 95 grams of carbon dioxide emission per km. Ferrari only has to achieve 277g of Co2 per km. Hence its average fleet emissions are still pretty high: The regulatory environment is, nonetheless, getting tougher. In several large markets there are plans to ban combustion engine vehicles altogether. Norway will do so from 2025, the U.K. might follow by 2030 and California will join them in 2035. In the nearer term, France wants to get people who buy polluting vehicle to pay an additional gas-guzzlers tax, which could add 50,000 euros ($58,630) to the cost of a Ferrari by 2022. Even deep-pocketed fans of the prancing horse might balk at that.Ferrari isn’t ignoring green matters The new SF90 Stradale is its first series production plug-in-hybrid, and by 2022 Ferrari says 60% of its models will have a hybrid powertrain. It won’t, though, have an electric car for several more years. In fairness, one can understand the caution. The fact that some Ferraris rarely leave the garage complicates the cost-benefit calculation of electrification. Manufacturing batteries produces carbon emissions too: The environmental benefits compared to a combustion engine improve the more a vehicle is driven.  And Camilleri, 65, isn’t sure that purist customers will make the electric switch. He thinks fully electric vehicles won’t comprise even half of Ferrari’s sales during his lifetime and they’ll never reach 100%. To put that in context, BloombergNEF projects that by 2040 electric models overall will comprise 58% of global vehicle sales.The problem for Camilleri is that tastes do change, especially if his rivals make compelling electric sportscars. While his desire to protect the brand is understandable, Ferrari also has a responsibility to lead on environmental matters because of its massive racing fanbase.The company risks losing a younger generation of car buyers who might start to prefer manufacturers such as Tesla Inc. Porsche has shown it’s possible to produce an electric sportscar — the Taycan — that doesn’t leave fans feeling shortchanged.Plus electric vehicles could be more profitable over the longer term than their combustion engine equivalents. By getting rid of the complex gasoline powertrain, a fully electric Ferrari might have a lower bill of materials. That would fatten the company’s industry-leading profit margins, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.Even then, one doubts Ferrari owners will consider using their vehicles to ferry the kids to class. If they did, an electric model would more likely be met with nods of approval by other parents, rather than a scowl.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

2020-11-05 06:44:32,Tesla or Nio: Which EV Stock Is A Better Pick Right Now?,TSLA,Yahoo,"Production disruptions and challenging economic conditions amid the pandemic have impacted the auto industry. But McKinsey notes that the electric vehicles or EV market has been surprisingly resilient in some countries. The consulting firm expects the EV market to recover and grow more strongly in China and Europe than in the US.Recently, Reuters reported that China’s State Council estimates sales of NEV (or New Energy Vehicles), which include battery electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, to account for 20% of overall new car sales by 2025 in the country (the largest EV market presently) from just 5% now.Keeping in mind these interesting trends in the EV market, we will use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to compare Tesla and Nio and see which stock offers a more compelling investment opportunity.Tesla (TSLA)No other automaker gets the kind of coverage that Elon Musk’s Tesla gets from analysts and investors alike. Even during these challenging times, the EV market leader managed to impress its investors by delivering profits for five consecutive quarters. In fact, Musk called Tesla’s 3Q performance the “best quarter in history.”Tesla’s 3Q revenue surged 39.2% Y/Y to $8.77 billion driven by a 44% rise in total deliveries to 139,593 vehicles. The company bounced back strongly following production disruptions due to the pandemic. Deliveries for the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover increased 56% Y/Y to 124,318 while deliveries of Model S and Model X declined 13% to 15,275. Overall, Tesla’s 3Q adjusted EPS surged 105% to $0.76 on strong top-line and margin expansion and its free cash flow jumped 276% to $1.4 billion.Following the earnings release, Robert W. Baird analyst Ben Kallo upgraded Tesla to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $488 from $450. The analyst acknowledged that he was too early to downgrade the stock in January. He also stated that Tesla's competitive moat over peers is substantial and believes the stock is a ""must own"" for those looking for exposure to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance), sustainability, and disruptive technology.Nonetheless, Tesla critics believe that the automaker has been profitable in recent quarters due to the inclusion of increased environmental regulatory credits. Tesla gets credits from state regulators for the production of zero-emission vehicles. Other automakers purchase such credits from Tesla to comply with emission regulations. In 3Q, Tesla’s revenue from regulatory credits increased 196% Y/Y to $397 million.Also, the company has cut its vehicle prices multiple times this year to stay competitive, especially in markets like China and certain analysts are concerned about the impact of such price cuts on margins over the long-term. However, it is notable that Tesla’s automotive gross margin (even after excluding tax credits) expanded to 23.7% in 3Q20 compared to 20.8% in 3Q19.Meanwhile, Tesla continues to aim for 500,000 deliveries this year despite pandemic-led production disruptions earlier this year. The company is investing heavily in capacity expansion at its Shanghai, China factory and is building new factories at Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)The company also sees huge growth potential for its energy generation and storage business. Revenue from this business grew 44% to $579 million in 3Q but accounted for only 6.6% of Tesla’s overall top-line.Tesla shares have risen by a staggering 403% this year. Which is why the average analyst price target of $379.26 indicates a possible downside of 9.9% in the months ahead. The Street is currently sidelined on the Stock with a Hold analyst consensus that breaks down into 9 Buys, 9 Holds and 9 Sells.Nio (NIO)Nio has emerged as a prominent player in the premium EV space in China. The company currently sells a 7-seater electric SUV ES8 and its variant the 6-seater ES8, a 5-seater electric SUV ES6 and the 5-seater electric coupe SUV EC6, for which the company started deliveries in September.Recently, J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai upgraded Nio to Buy from Hold and raised his price target to $40 from $14 as he views the company as a long term winner in the China premium EV space. He expects Nio to command ~30% of the premium passenger EV market or reach 334,000 units by 2025.Nio shares have been rising this week on multiple favorable updates. On Nov. 4, Nio shares surged 6% as Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung raised his price target to a Street-high of $46.40 from $33.20. The analyst has a bullish outlook for China's NEV sector and believes that the company has a better product cycle in 2021.Chung reiterated a Buy rating for Nio based on “(1) very strong order backlog (1-5-1.8 month level) with high margin visibility; (2) 3Q20E gross processing margin likely to reach 13-16% level, followed by 4Q20E gross processing margin at 22-25% level; (3) increase in market share; (4) battery cost reduction; and (5) policy tailwind related to exports.”Shares also rose following unconfirmed media reports that Nio is entering the European market with the launch of its ES8 and ES6 models next year. And earlier this week Nio provided a business update, which indicated that the company’s EV deliveries doubled Y/Y to 5,055 in October. This brings Nio’s total year-to-date deliveries in 2020 to 31,430, reflecting a 111.4% growth.All eyes are set on Nio’s upcoming 3Q results scheduled on Nov. 17. Last month, the company reported that its vehicle deliveries surged 154.3% Y/Y to 12,206 in 3Q. (See NIO stock analysis on TipRanks)With shares rising by an unbelievable 838% year-to-date, the average analyst price target of $25.69 indicates a downside potential of about 32% in the coming months. The Street is cautiously optimistic on Nio. A Moderate Buy analyst consensus for the stock is based on 6 Buys versus 3 Holds and 1 Sell.ConclusionBoth Tesla and Nio shares have already skyrocketed so far this year. As a result the Street does not see further upside in either of these EV makers in the coming months. Tesla has a strong business model and the technology to capture further market share in the EV space and energy market in the years ahead. But, right now the analyst consensus indicates that the Street has a better outlook on Nio based on its rapid growth and its ability to further capture market share in the lucrative China premium EV space.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

The 300-employee company had a five-year growth rate of 2,365% as of September last year, according to Canadian Business.Pride Group's order is larger than the 130 units ordered by Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) in Canada.

But another wave of new infections in key markets, an unsettled U.S. election and Britain’s messy exit from the European Union are now among the risks to further economic stabilization.Car registrations fell in Europe’s four largest auto markets last month, signaling that sales have relapsed after a surprise gain in September.Diess, 62, will face perhaps the most complex task of any CEO leading the rapidly changing car industry into the post-pandemic world. He’s tried to create a new culture at the 83-year-old industrial behemoth, putting as much emphasis on technology and software chops as manufacturing prowess. Pulling that off has been made all-the-more challenging by divisions within VW’s supervisory board and powerful works council that publicly clashed with the former BMW AG executive earlier this year.Diess has boosted efforts to rein in costs at VW’s namesake passenger-car brand and embarked on an aggressive plan to build the industry’s largest electric-vehicle lineup. While incumbent automakers wrestle with overhauls of their legacy operations, Tesla has surged ahead to become the world’s most-valuable car manufacturer, even as it generates far less cash and sells fewer vehicles than VW or Toyota Motor Corp.That puts VW under pressure to keep pace with technology development, even as the pandemic roils day-to-day business.“If you’re not fast enough, you’re not going to survive,” Diess said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P."

2020-11-05 10:31:30,"Tesla, French Partner Neoen, To Build Another Gigantic Lithium-Ion Battery In Australia",TSLA,Yahoo,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is partnering with Paris-based independent energy producer Neoen SA to set up a massive lithium-ion battery site in Australia.What Happened: Neoen will be responsible for handling the grid's system integrity, the Financial Times reports. Whereas, Tesla will supply its megapack technology. The battery plant could be operational sometime towards the end of 2021.The 300-megawatt Victorian Big Battery plant will be located in Geelong city in Australia's second-most populous state -- Victoria.The move is in sync with Australia's renewable energy targets. Presently, the Australian government is aiming for 50% power generation from renewable sources by 2030.Why Does It Matter: Energy Minister for the Victorian State, Lily D'Ambrosio, told Bloomberg that the project would not only support the economy with reduced energy prices and increased jobs but also support the network grids during Australia's extreme summers. The state's energy grid is powered by coal-reliant energy plants, which failed in recent summers leading to power outages.Before the Victorian project, the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker partnered with the French company for the Hornsdale wind farm project, which was the largest facility supporting essential grid services when it began operations in 2017. It was dethroned from the top spot in August, with the opening of the 230-megawatt project in San Diego, California, Bloomberg reported separately.Price Action: Tesla shares traded 2.86% higher at $433 in the pre-market session on Thursday.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Why Qualcomm Shares Surged Over 12% After-Hours Wednesday  * Jeff Bezos Sells Another B Worth Of Amazon Shares(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

2020-11-17 17:11:15,Tesla Stock Will Join the S&P 500 — but Still May Not Be a Buy,TSLA,Nasdaq,"At 6:44 p.m. EST Monday, the news hit the wires: Tesla (TSLA) is finally joining the S&P 500.If you recall, the S&P Dow Jones Indices' index committee's failure to include Tesla in its index of America's 500 largest companies back in September contributed to the stock's muted performance that month. Indeed, the day the S&P announced its decision, Sept. 8, saw Tesla stock plummet 21% in value in a single day -- a dramatic decline that tells you just how much investors had been banking on Tesla ""making the cut,"" and on index funds and ETFs that track the S&P 500's composition being forced to buy the stock when it became included.On Monday, however, the index committee rectified that oversight, announcing that Tesla will in fact be added to the S&P 500 index on Monday, Dec. 21, ""to coincide with the December quarterly rebalance."" It has not yet been decided what other company will be removed from the index (to keep the number steady at ""500,"" if Tesla's going in... someone else has to fall out). Nor has it been decided whether Tesla will join the index all at once on Dec. 21 or, because of the size of the company and its potential to shift the value of the index, be added more gradually, ""in two separate tranches ending on the rebalance effective date.""Responding to the news, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives called S&P's decision ""a major feather in the cap for the Tesla bulls,"" surmising that the index committee may have held off on adding Tesla to the index while waiting to see whether Tesla could sustain and extend its streak of profitable quarters. When Tesla reported a $331 million net profit on Oct. 21, though, that put all such concerns to bed.Nonetheless, says Ives, and regardless of how Tesla's stock price reacts on Tuesday, he is maintaining only a ""neutral"" rating on Tesla stock, and a price target of $500 a share. (To watch Ives' track record, click here)Why not ""buy"" Tesla? Why not give the stock a higher price target? Ives cautions that the electric vehicle revolution is ""still in the very early innings."" With only about 3% of total global automobile sales being of electrics at present, it may be too soon to declare Tesla the out and out winner in this market (all evidence to the contrary so far notwithstanding). While Ives does believe that ""EV auto sales could disproportionately benefit as more consumers purchase an array of EV models hitting the road in 2021,"" many of those models are from manufacturers not named Tesla.It remains to be seen which manufacturer will win the bulk of the market in Europe and in China. China in particular, says Ives, ""could represent up to 40% of overall deliveries for Musk & Co. in 2022,"" and be worth as much as $80 a share to the stock -- but only if Tesla wins the market there.Overall, the battle seems to be torn between the bulls and bears as TipRanks analytics demonstrate the electric car giant as a Hold. Based on 28 analysts tracked in the last 3 months, 9 rate TSLA a Buy, 10 say Hold, while 9 recommend Sell. With a potential downside of 14%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $380.13.

2020-12-04 02:22:54,Nio vs Tesla: Which Stock Looks More Attractive As EV Competition Heats Up?,TSLA,Nasdaq,"Recent numbers reported by Nio, Xpeng and Tesla clearly indicate the growing demand for electric vehicles, driven by technological advances and favorable sustainability policies. EV adoption is increasing and Goldman Sachs now expects EVs to account for 18% of global new light vehicle sales in 2030 and speed up to 29% in 2035.Goldman Sachs explains that EV penetration is accelerating as battery prices are falling faster than expected, which improves the economics of owning an EV. Also, it cites the recent increase in regulatory proposals from some jurisdictions to limit or ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles entirely in 10-20 years as another catalyst for EV sales.So, with a favorable demand backdrop, we will pit EV leader Tesla against its nemesis, Nio, and use the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool to select the more attractive stock.Nio (NIO)China-based premium EV maker Nio is racing in the world’s largest EV market with its 7-seater and 6-seater electric SUV ES8, 5-seater electric SUV ES6 and the recently launched 5-seater electric coupe SUV EC6. Nio investors have hit the jackpot as shares have gained about 1,028% year-to-date.So, what has fueled this unbelievable rally? Well, the reasons include a strong third quarter, bullish outlook on China’s NEV (New Energy Vehicles) market and media reports about Nio entering the European market with the launch of its ES8 and ES6 models in 2021.Adding to the positive sentiment, Nio this week reported its November deliveries, which more than doubled year-over-year to 5,291 vehicles. This brings the total deliveries so far this year to 36,721, reflecting a 111% year-over-year increase. (See NIO stock analysis on TipRanks)The demand that Nio is experiencing is so strong that the company has now decided to accelerate its capacity expansion in December to keep up with the rising orders. Last month, Nio’s CEO William Bin Li stated, “In view of the growing market demand for our competitive products, we are motivated to continuously elevate the production capacity to the next level. We expect to deliver 16,500 to 17,000 vehicles in the coming fourth quarter.”Nio’s improving prospects prompted Goldman Sachs analyst Fei Fang to upgrade the stock to Hold from Sell and boost the price target to $59 from $7.70. In a note to investors, Fang stated, “In hindsight, we underestimated the benefits to Nio from: (1) powertrain breakthroughs, particularly with the cell-to-pack/blade large cell technologies; (2) the introduction of Nio’s battery as a service (BaaS) program, which has significantly expanded Nio’s addressable market; and (3) regulatory incentives that turned around EV market demand from an ongoing decline. Combined, all of these factors have provided significant tailwinds to Nio’s sale volumes.”On Wednesday, UBS analyst Paul Gong also raised his price target on NIO to $55 from $16.30, while maintaining a Hold rating.Looking ahead, there is a lot of buzz surrounding the company’s annual event, ""Nio Day"", slated for January, where the EV maker is expected to launch its first sedan.Currently, the Street has a cautiously optimistic outlook on Nio, with a Moderate Buy analyst consensus that breaks down into 7 Buys and 4 Holds. Given the staggering year-to-date rise, the average price target of $49.01 reflects an upside potential of 8.1% in the months ahead.     Tesla (TSLA)Tesla is firing on all cylinders and the EV pioneer is taking the right measures to sustain its global leadership. Following pandemic-led disruptions earlier this year, Tesla bounced back in remarkable fashion, with a 44% rise in deliveries to 139,593 in the third quarter—CEO Elon Musk called it the “best quarter in history.” Tesla’s long-awaited inclusion in the S&P 500 and five consecutive profitable quarters have led to a meteoric year-to-date rise of 609% in its stock. The company is now focusing on cutting its costs and improving its profitability while investing billions of dollars in capacity expansion at the Shanghai factory and new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)Emphasizing the focus on the bottom line, Musk stated in an email (which Electrek had access to) to employees, “Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability, but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!”Improving its profitability is even more vital for Tesla as it intends to make its EVs more affordable at a time when auto giants like Ford and General Motors are ramping up their EV investments and China-based EV makers are coming after its market share.Meanwhile, Tesla is gearing up to expand its market share in the huge Chinese EV market. The company was already selling its Model 3 electric cars in China and has now been granted permission to sell its Shanghai-made Model Y SUVs in the region. On Dec. 2, Goldman Sachs flipped from the sidelines to a Tesla bull, with a Street-high price target of $780 (up from $455). Writing for Goldman Sachs, Mark Delaney highlighted the accelerating EV adoption and stated, “Importantly, we expect that Tesla’s integrated model (including its coupling of custom hardware and software, platform approach with significant parts overlap between key products like the Model 3 and Y, and its ability to offer a full ecosystem of products for consumers including solar, storage, and convenient access to fast charging) will help it to sustain a leadership position in the EV market.”“If Tesla sustains its mid to high 20% range share of the EV market, then it could reach 15 mn units by 2040 (and about 20 mn under our upside-case EV market adoption scenario),” added Delaney.Additionally, Delaney believes that Tesla’s energy and full self-driving software businesses could be more valuable than he previously anticipated. The analyst also expects the company’s margins to expand due to a favorable mix shift to Model Y.The Street, meanwhile, has a Hold analyst consensus on Tesla with 10 Buys, 8 Holds and 7 Sells. Given the staggering rise in the shares, the average price target of $403.24 indicates a possible downside of 32% from current levels.  ConclusionTesla’s technology, innovations, leadership in the EV space and improving profitability make it an attractive long-term play. However, the Street is essentially sidelined on the stock mainly due to its sky-high valuation, and as several critics point out—the role of emission credits in making Tesla profitable in recent quarters. The Street currently has a more favorable near-term outlook on Nio stock.

2020-12-07 18:07:35,Goldman Sachs Picks 2 Electric Car Stocks to Buy (And 1 to Watch),TSLA,Nasdaq,"Reducing carbon emissions is all the vogue among the green policy wonks these days, and whether you believe in the efficacy of those policies or not, one thing is undeniable: they will have an impact on your daily life. Specifically, they will impact the cars you drive – and probably your fuel and electric bills as well.It’s no secret that the Trump Administration has favored the oil and gas industry, and in fact, gasoline prices have declined during the past four years. The incoming Biden Administration is expected to look far more favorably on green policies, particularly the electrification of the automobile fleet. Electric vehicles have been with us for a while, and some models are achieving popularity and driver approval. The next step will be a governmental push, via policy, to make EVs cheaper to build, more affordable to buy, and more practical on the road.In a recent report from Goldman Sachs, the investment giant foresees global sales of electric vehicles hitting 1.8 million units this year, with 8.3 million by 2025 and an impressive 34 million by 2035. The result of this will be a reduction in the conventional car/electric car ratio of 18%.With this in mind, Goldman’s stock analysts are tapping two electric vehicle companies which are likely to succeed in the climate of the next four years – and one to watch from the sidelines. We've used the TipRanks database to get a better sense of what other Wall Street analysts think about the trio. Li Auto (LI)Li Auto is one of the myriad EV production companies that has cropped up in China in recent years. The Chinese domestic car market should not be overlooked – the country has a population near 1.4 billion, with some 800 million in the urban areas, and as a whole, China is rapidly growing wealthier. Li specializes in plug-in hybrids, which combine combustion engines and an electric drive train – and are especially useful in a country with a limited EV charging network. Li first model, the Li ONE, was put on the market in November of last year, and by this past October, the company had sold over 22,000 cars. That month, the sales volume hit 3,700, making the Li ONE China’s best-selling electric vehicle model. This company is a newcomer to the US stock markets, having held its IPO at the end of July this year. Share debuted on the market at $11.50, higher than the initial projected range. Since the IPO, shares in LI have gained 173%. Covering Li Auto for Goldman Sachs, analyst Fei Fang writes, “We believe Li Auto is differentiating itself from the broader Chinese auto-making industry by envisioning and creating compelling EV consumer experiences – and showing a willingness to take on the risk of unconventional technologies and act innovatively… driving transformations that will lead the long-term adoption of EVs in China. We view Li ONE as the first step in a larger innovation plan that will provide significant optionality value for the share price.”To this end, Fang rates LI a Buy along with a $60 price target. At current levels, this implies a 91% one-year upside. (To watch Fang’s track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on LI. 3 Buys and 1 Hold issued over the previous three months make the stock a ‘Strong Buy.' It should also be noted that its $36.65 average price target suggests 16% upside from the current share price. (See LI stock analysis on TipRanks)Tesla (TSLA)This company needs no introduction; Elon Musk, with his genius for promotion and notoriety, has seen to that over the past few years. He’s been helped along by the company’s successful efforts to address quality control and production bottlenecks, while introducing popular new models. The result: TSLA stock has skyrocketed 667% in 2020.The huge spike in share value has accompanied record-setting profits. Tesla turned profitable in 3Q19, and has remained so despite the impact of corona. The company’s 3Q20 results were nothing short of remarkable. Revenues rose to $8.8 billion, a 39% year-over-year gain and an even bigger 46% sequential gain. EPS rose 105% year-over-year, to hit 76 cents per share. And even better for the car maker: the free cash flow is solid, at $1.4 billion for the quarter.The third quarter results stood on a solid foundation of production and deliveries. The company reported 145,000 vehicles manufactured in the quarter, with nearly 140,000 delivered. Improvements in delivery efficiency have helped the company to cut back on its new vehicle inventory.Goldman analyst Mark Delaney is bullish on Tesla – and on the EV sector’s future, in general. He writes, “We believe that the shift toward battery electric vehicle (EV) adoption is accelerating and will occur faster than our prior view. We believe that battery prices are falling faster than we previously expected which improves the economics of EV ownership, and there has recently been an increase in regulatory proposals from some jurisdictions to limit or ban the sale of new internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles entirely in 10-20 years.”Backing his bullish stance, Delaney rates TSLA a Buy. His price target, of $780, suggests an upside of 21% in the next 12 months. (To watch Delaney’s track record, click here)However, despite the huge gains in recent months, or maybe because of that, Wall Street remains cautious of Tesla. The analyst consensus rating is a Hold, based on 25 reviews, including 10 Buys, 8 Holds, and 7 Sells. The stock’s average price target is $403.24, indicating a possible downside of 37% from current levels. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)Nio (NIO)Last on our list is Goldman’s neutral call on Nio, another Chinese electric vehicle company. Nio has, in recent months, managed to stand out from China’s crowded domestic EV market, introducing new models and innovative ideas. The company’s current line-up includes three mid-size SUVs powered by lithium-ion batteries, and sports car, a 2-door coupe with water-cooled electric motors. The company has several models, including two sedans, a minivan, and another SUV, lined up for future release.Among the customer-oriented ideas that Nio is working with is ‘Battery as a Service,’ or BaaS. This concept divorces the battery from the vehicle, allowing car owners to purchase a monthly subscription and ‘refuel’ their vehicle by swapping out the battery assembly.Earnings, while still at a net loss, have been improving for the past four quarters, and Q3 revenue came in at $4.53 billion, the best in over a year. Year-to-date, NIO shares have shown tremendous growth -- the stock is up over 1000%.Noting that Nio has strength in its leading position in the market, Goldman's Fei Fang writes of the risks: “While Nio’s brand has been impressively established, we expect competition to heat up in the coming years with large OEMs launching comparable models, such as ID4 and Model Y… If our projected battery price declines / excess capacity does not come through and the industry works with tight manufacturing capacity and hefty EV component prices, it would weigh on Nio’s margin expansion.”Fang gives NIO shares a Neutral (i.e. Hold) rating. But the analyst might as well have said “buy” — because he thinks the stock, currently at $45.11, could zoom ahead to $57 within a year, delivering 31% profits to new investors. Overall, Nio’s stock gets a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 7 Buys and 4 Holds. Meanwhile, the $49.01 average price target implies nearly 9% upside.

2020-12-08 21:20:50,"Tesla: Latest Capital Raise Another Smart Move, Says Analyst",TSLA,Nasdaq,"Tesla (TSLA) shares are on the rise again, adding another 15% so far this month. The green candles have been a familiar sight in 2020, with investors’ appetite for the EV pioneer seemingly unquenchable. Overall, the stock is up by a massive 676% year-to-date.Taking advantage of the latest surge, the company disclosed on Tuesday that it had entered an equity distribution agreement to sell $5 billion’s worth of shares. The shares will periodically be sold ATM (at the market).While Tesla’s massive share gains are becoming almost par for the course, Musk and Co.’s capital raises are also a regular occurrence. Tesla often sold stock in its early cash strapped years and has continued to so even after fleshing out the balance sheet. In fact, this is the third multibillion-dollar stock sale this year.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives says that following the recent “parabolic rally,” it is “the smart move at the right time.”Referencing the previous raises, the analyst highlights how they “took the doomsday scenario off the table that Tesla was facing at the time.”Ives claims the raises were also essential in helping to construct the “linchpin Giga 3 factory in China,” and prepare the groundwork for the “sustained profitability” which led to the S&P 500 inclusion.Ives believes the latest effort to shore up the “treasure chest” should pay also off.“Now in a clear position of strength and out of the red ink with major factory build outs on the horizon (Austin and Berlin), Musk and his red cape are raising enough capital to get the balance sheet and capital structure to further firm up its growing cash position and slowly get out of its debt situation, which throws the lingering bear thesis for Tesla out the window for now,” the 5-star analyst said.Despite applauding the move, Ives keeps a Neutral (i.e. Hold) rating on TSLA shares, with a “base” price target of $560. This figure implies ~14% downside from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)Overall, Tesla might be a firm favorite amongst investors, but the Street has habitually considered it overvalued; The current readout is no different. With the average price target set to $403.24, the forecast is for a 38% decline in the share price over the next 12 months. The stock has a Hold consensus rating, based on 10 Buys, 8 Holds and 7 Sells.

2020-12-09 20:12:24,J.P. Morgan Sees Doom and Gloom in Tesla Stock Despite Recent S&P 500 Inclusion,TSLA,Nasdaq,"On December 21, Tesla’s (TSLA) long wait to be included in the S&P 500 comes to an end. Having proven itself capable of turning a profit for four consecutive quarters – the minimum requirement for inclusion – the EV pioneer will takes its place alongside the other 499 leading US’ listed companies in what is generally considered to be the stock market’s benchmark index.Ahead of the anticipated event, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman has been fielding calls from investors wondering if they should buy Tesla shares “given that many funds’ performance is evaluated against this benchmark.”To which Brinkman has a succinct and blunt answer.“We recommend investors not weight Tesla shares in their portfolio in equal proportion to the S&P because Tesla shares are in our view and by virtually every conventional metric not only overvalued, but dramatically so.”“For instance,” Brinkman adds, “Tesla trades at 1,325x LTM P/E and at 291x 2020E and 175x NTM Bloomberg consensus EPS (vs. best in class auto comps BMW, Daimler, and Toyota 14x, 10x, and 16x NTM EPS, respectively).”While many analysts have sounded the alarm bells time and again on Tesla’s stratospheric valuation, investors who have taken the plunge in spite of the warnings, have been handsomely rewarded over the years.However, Brinkman says that before making any rash Tesla stock purchases ahead of the S&P 500 inclusion, investors should consider another metric.Tesla’s share price has ballooned by 808% over the past 2 years, and in that period, on average, analysts’ 12-month price targets have increased by 451%. Over the same time, the analysts have also “simultaneously lowered their estimates for Tesla EPS for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.”This is baffling to Brinkman.“As difficult as this is to conceive ― that the shares would be worth +808% more despite lower than previously expected earnings,” the analyst says, “This is what the Bloomberg data shows, and it is strongly suggestive of the idea that something apart from the fundamentals (speculative fervor?) is driving the shares higher.”According to Brinkman, though, the shares are definitely heading lower. Despite raising the price target from $80 to $90 due to Tesla’s recent $5 billion at-the-market offering, it is still a steep 86% drop from current levels. Needless to say, Brinkman’s rating stays an Underweight (i.e. Sell). (To watch Brinkman’s track record, click here)While the Street’s overall projection is not quite as bearish as Brinkman’s, it is not all that promising, either. Based on 10 Buys, 8 Holds and 7 Sells, the stock has a Hold consensus rating. Given the $403.24 average price target, the Street expects Tesla shares to be changing hands at a 37% discount a year from now.

The S and X lines are older models and only accounted for around 11% of deliveries in the third quarter, with the newer Model 3 and Model Y versions making up the rest.Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk informed employees working on those production lines at the Fremont, California factory on Friday that they were being offered one full week of paid leave, and were encouraged to try and find work in other areas of the factory, or alternatively, to “volunteer” to assist the company in making deliveries to customers during the shutdown.Tesla announced in October that it was recalling nearly 50,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in China over potentially unsafe suspension issues. Further questions arose in November when Tesla declared that it was refunding some Model S and Model X owners and extending its warranty due to touchscreen blackouts and other problems.When questioned by CNBC about Tesla’s intentions regarding the Model S and Model X lines during the shutdown, Tesla failed to immediately offer a response. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney recently upgraded his rating on the stock to a Buy and increased his price target from $455 to a Street high target of $780 (28% upside potential). He believes that EV penetration will happen quicker than he first projected and that EV sales will account for 15% of new car sales by 2025.Consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 8 Buys, 10 Holds and 7 Sells. The average price target of $392.40 implies a potential decline of around 36% over the next 12 months.Related News:Virgin Galactic Aborts Key Test Flight After Motor Failure – ReportBroadcom Beats 4Q Street Estimates; Shares Fall Amid Management ReshuffleOracle’s 2Q Profit Beats The Street Driven By Strong Cloud Demand"

2020-12-21 21:09:48,"Tesla: Demand in China a Strong Tailwind Heading Into 2021, Says Top Analyst",TSLA,Nasdaq,"New vehicle technology has been one of the stock market’s hottest trends this year. EV (electric vehicle) stocks, in particular, have caught investors’ imaginations, with several names providing mighty returns.While out on Main Street, EV penetration is still in its early innings, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes it is a trend that will only become more prominent as the decade progresses. The analyst says there is a “major inflection of EV demand globally,” and expects EV vehicles to ramp up from roughly “3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025.”Whilst several companies will try to gain market share in the fledgling industry, Ives expects one company to benefit the most.“We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla (TSLA) over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales,” the 5-star analyst said.The far east superpower is already staking its claim to be at the forefront of the EV revolution and the past year has seen several companies - Nio, Xpeng, and Li - vying for market share, along with Tesla.Ives believes sales in the region could “potentially double” over the next few years given the “pent-up demand for EV vehicles across all price points.”While Tesla is in the process of expanding its global “manufacturing footprint,” with new factories set to be built in Berlin and Austin over the next year, China still “remains the ‘hearts and lungs’ of the Tesla demand growth story.”Ives believes the latest data indicates “another strong month of December in China,” with the aim of delivering 500,000 models in 2020 still achievable.For 2021, Ives expects over 40% growth, anticipating 710,000 deliveries, which should set “Tesla on a strong growth trajectory into 2022.”Interestingly, despite the glowing assessment, Ives rates TSLA shares a  Neutral (i.e. Hold). Meanwhile, his $715 price target indicates a potential upside of 10% from current levels. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)All in all, Street-wide caution circles the electric car giant, as TipRanks analytics model TSLA as a Hold. This boils down to 7 Buys, 11 Holds, and 7 Sells. With an average price target of $430.71, Tesla investors are in for a rude awakening in 2021, as the figure suggests downside of 33% over the next 12 months.

2020-12-23 05:09:12,Tesla’s Elon Musk Says Apple CEO Turned Back On Takeover Call,TSLA,Nasdaq,"Tesla Inc.’s billionaire founder Elon Musk disclosed that he had in the past approached Apple CEO Tim Cook to start talks about a potential takeover of the electric car maker for one-tenth of its current value.“During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value),” Tesla’s (TSLA) Musk wrote in a Twitter post, adding that Cook “refused to take the meeting.”Musk made the comments in reaction to a Reuters story that Apple (AAPL) is stepping up its self-driving car technology and is planning to produce a passenger vehicle by 2024 that could include its own breakthrough battery technology.The sweet spot to Apple’s strategy is a new battery design that could “radically” lower the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle’s range, Reuters said, citing a person who has seen Apple’s battery design. The iPhone maker plans to use a unique “monocell” design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials.“A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low,” Musk wrote in Twitter post replies. “Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?”Meanwhile, Reuters also reported that Apple had put Doug Field, who had previously also worked at Tesla, in charge to oversee its automotive project, also known as Project Titan.Tesla shares closed 1.5% lower on Tuesday. The stock is down 2.4% over the past three days following its inclusion in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. On a year-to-date basis, the shares have exploded 665%. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)This week, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives ramped up TSLA’s price target to $715 (12% upside potential) from $560, but still maintained a Hold rating as he expects increased demand for EV vehicles going into 2021. Ives estimates that EV vehicles will make up 10% of total auto sales by 2025 compared to 3% today.“We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. “China could see eye popping demand into 2021 and 2022 across the board with Tesla's flagship Giga 3 footprint a major competitive advantage, as domestic players such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng, and Li also are also firing on all cylinders.”This year’s stellar rally has left the rest of Wall Street analysts mostly sidelined on the stock. The Hold analyst consensus shows 11 Holds, 7 Sells and 7 Buys. That’s with an average price target of $ 446.59, implying 30% downside potential lies ahead over the coming 12 months.Related News:Apple Sets 2024 Target For Vehicle Production – ReportSportsman’s Warehouse Pops 37% On Great American Buyout Deal; Street Says BuyXpeng Starts EV Sale In Norway To Enter European Market"

2020-12-29 02:31:32,Tesla To Debut In India Early Next Year – Report,TSLA,Nasdaq,"Tesla will start selling electric vehicles (EV) in India early next year, Nitin Gadkari, the country’s transport minister confirmed during an interview with The Indian Express newspaper.The minister disclosed that Tesla (TSLA) will begin its operations with sales in the Indian market and then maybe look for assembly and manufacturing facilities. Last week, ETAuto.com reported that the first model to be launched in India could be the Model 3 Sedan, the cheapest among Tesla vehicles. The bookings may start in January, according to ETAuto.com. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)Replying to a tweet, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said on Sunday that the company plans to enter the Indian market in 2021 but it is not happening in January.On Dec. 21, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised the stock’s price target to $715 (7.7% upside potential) from $560 and reiterated a Hold rating. In a note to investors, Ives wrote “Heading into year-end and 2021, we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales.”Meanwhile, the consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 11 Holds, 7 Buys and 7 Sells. With shares skyrocketing 693.3% year-to-date, the average price target of $455.22 implies downside potential of about 31.4% to current levels.

2020-12-29 07:49:30,"EV Stocks Could be Big Business in 2021, But Street Says Hold off on Tesla",TSLA,Nasdaq,"Going into 2021, the new darlings of Wall Street are electric vehicle (EV) makers and the manufacturers that support them with batteries and parts.Wall Street can spot a new trend a mile away. It’s all about Green and Clean, and EV’s are exactly that. UK, European and Chinese lawmakers have been charging at warp speed towards electrifying their roads, in order to decrease noxious emissions.In the U.S. under Trump though, the government was pushing in the exact opposite direction, and that is towards the lucrative oil industry. But with Biden as the new President, everything has changed. Biden has made it clear in his manifesto that climate change is a key proponent of his policy and his objective is to reach a national target of zero carbon emissions by 2050.Competition among EV-makers is becoming ever more fierce, with General Motors (GM) announcing plans to launch 30 fully electric cars by 2025, representing 40% of its sales and new EV-makers appearing almost overnight.That said, Tesla (TSLA) is overbought, Nio (NIO) is operating at a loss and GM is trading at 6.7 times consensus earnings estimate for the next yearLooking to the analyst community, Nio earns a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 8 Buy ratings and 4 Holds. Its average price target of $49.84 implies 13% upside potential. (See Nio stock analysis on TipRanks)Meanwhile, the pros are cautious about Tesla. Its Hold analyst consensus breaks down into 7 Buys, 11 Holds and 7 Sells. At $455.22, the average price target implies 31% downside potential. (See Tesla stock analysis on TipRanks)Is there another way to gain access to this growing market? Yes, there is and it’s via ETFs. ETFs can give you exposure to a huge range of EV-makers and the companies that support them, allowing investors to take a diversified view on this industry, rather than trading each of the components individually. It is a way to speculate on a theme or an industry. Wall Street seems to believe that EVs are the theme of 2021, and this is a way to gain exposure to that idea.The overall objective of EV ETFs is to track the investment results of a basket of stocks comprised of companies that are linked to electric vehicles, battery technologies and autonomous driving technologies. An ETF is a long-term approach to investing with regards to growth and gives investors the ability to invest in global stocks from both developed and emerging economies.Take a look at the chart below, which compares the value of the S&P 500 and the DJIA to SPDR S&P Kensho Smart Mobility ETF HAIL, Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF DRIV and iShares Self-driving EV & Tech ETF IDRV over the course of the last six months. Remember, this shows a year when Trump was in office with his pro-oil sentiment, and before EV makers really made the headlines (apart from Tesla).So, is 2021 the year of the EV? If Wall Street thinks so, we won’t argue.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

2020-12-30 02:05:08,Tesla Inks 5-Year Deal To Buy Lithium From China’s Sichuan Yahua – Report,TSLA,Nasdaq,"Tesla has inked a five-year deal to buy lithium hydroxide for its electric vehicle (EV) batteries from China's Sichuan Yahua Industrial Group Co. Reuters reported citing Yahua's stock exchange filing.Per the filing, the total contract value would be about $630-$880 million over 2021-25. Reuters also reported that Tesla  (TSLA) already gets lithium from the world's leading lithium producer Ganfeng Lithium, based in China.The deal comes as Tesla is set to start selling its electric vehicles (EV) in the Indian market. In an interview with The Indian Express newspaper, India's transport minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed that Tesla will begin its operations with sales and could later look for assembly and manufacturing facilities, depending upon the sales response.  (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)On Dec. 29, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a price target of $715 (7.4% upside potential) and a Hold rating on the stock. Ives believes that Tesla will be able to achieve its target of 500k deliveries of EVs this year, ""given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the US."" Ives added, ""While there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.""Meanwhile, the consensus among analysts is a Hold based on 11 Holds, 7 Buys and 7 Sells. With shares soaring over 696% year-to-date, the average price target of $458.70 implies downside potential of about 31.1% to current levels.Related News:Tesla To Debut In India Early Next Year – ReportLockheed Martin Delivers 123 F-35 Fighter Jets In 2020 As Covid-19 Hits SupplyFedEx Completes ShopRunner Acquisition; Stock Up 74% YTD"

2020-12-30 08:20:46,2020 Tesla Deliveries Will Beat Expectations — But the Stock Is Still a ‘Sell’,TSLA,Nasdaq,"According to Elon Musk, Tesla (TSLA) will end 2020 delivering 500,000 electric cars to its customers. According to Wall Street, however, Tesla is going to miss that target -- and maybe by a lot.Cowen & Co. predicts Tesla will miss its mark by more than 30,000 cars, while RBC Capital projects Tesla will fall only about 10,000 cars short of the mark, and JMP Securities thinks 9,000. Wedbush, Needham & Co., and Tiger Securities -- all of these investment banks, too, are publicly predicting that Tesla will fall short of its 500,000 cars-in-a-single-year goal, albeit by slimmer margins.But ""Tesla Bear"" Gordon Johnson at GLJ Research? He thinks Tesla's going to hit its number, and then some.Johnson lays out his thesis, first by dismissing his fellow analysts' predictions of a sales miss (""the sell-side sandbags on forward delivery ests, making it easy for TSLA to ""beat""), and then explaining why in his opinion, Tesla will in fact beat estimates for deliveries this quarter -- and why it doesn't matter.Basically, Johnson's thinking goes like this: arms-length commercial transactions between Tesla electric cars and its car-buying consumers in Q4 2020 will in fact be only about 174,000, explains Johnson. But if Musk left things like that, he would fall 8,000 cars short of his promised 500,000 deliveries for the year -- a big disappointment. So to get the 182,000 deliveries he needs in Q4, to complete his promised 500,000 cars delivered for the year, Musk will have Tesla supplement ""real-world"" sales with a combination of sales to corporate and rental car fleets, to car leasing companies, to car sellers, and to ""related parties.""With these supplemental sales factored in, Johnson projects that Tesla will easily pass the 182,000-car mark for Q4, selling perhaps as many as 184,000 Teslas, and thus ""beating estimates"" for 500,000 deliveries for the year.And yet, in Johnson's view, ""500,000"" isn't really the right number to focus on -- first because it's an artificial goal line that will be artificially crossed, but second because 500,000 is already a lowball number. As the analyst reminds, ""in 2018 TSLA guided 2020 deliveries to 750K-1mn"" cars delivered, and before that, Musk had guided ""2020 deliveries to 1mn in 2016."" Johnson predicts (and history suggests he's right about this) that ""the lion's share of media outlets [will nevertheless] forget TSLA's 2018 guidance for 2020 deliveries of 750K-1mn cars, and praise the coming [500,000+] deliveries beat as a ""big win"" for the company.""And this brings us to the crux of the matter: Would 500,000 deliveries in a single year really be a ""big win"" for Tesla? When you consider that established automaker Ford sells 500,000 cars every 34 days, General Motors sells 500,000 cars in 24 days, and Volkswagen needs just 17 days to sell 500,000 cars, while Tesla currently sports a market capitalization of more than three times the market value of Ford, GM, and Volkswagen combined, Johnson continues to insist that Tesla's valuation remains seriously out of whack. In short, Johnson rates the stock a ""sell"" and sets a $40 price target on the $666-priced stock. This figure implies a 94% downside from current levels. (To watch Johnson's track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street is evenly split between a battle of bulls vs. bears on this electric car giant. Out of 25 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 7 are bullish, 11 remain sidelined, and 7 are bearish on TSLA -- all add up to a Hold consensus rating. With a potential downside of ~31%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $457.83.

Deliveries for 2020 surpassed analysts’ expectations of 481,261 units, but fell fractionally short of  CEO Elon Musk’s 500,000 target.Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y crossover SUV and Model 3 Sedan made up 88.6% of the total 2020 deliveries while the older Model S and X accounted for the rest. During the year, Tesla shipped 442,511 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles while it delivered 57,039 units of Model S and X.The company said, “Our delivery count should be viewed as slightly conservative, as we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and all paperwork is correct. Final numbers could vary by up to 0.5% or more.” (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)In 4Q, the company shipped 180,570 electric vehicles, which came in 61.2% higher than the 112,000 units it had delivered in the year-ago quarter. Of the total, 161,650 were for the Model 3 and Model Y, reflecting year-over-year growth of 74.7%. However, shipments for Model S and X declined 2.7% to 18,920 units year-on-year. Its total production during the quarter increased by 71.4% year-over-year to 179,757 vehicles.Additionally, the company announced that Model Y production has started in Shanghai and the deliveries could begin shortly.Ahead of its quarterly production and shipment numbers, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives had reiterated his Hold rating as well as the price target of $715 (1.3% upside potential). In a note to investors, Ives wrote, “Based on our initial analysis of demand and the delivery trajectory globally for Tesla in 4Q, it appears Musk & Co. will likely handily exceed Street and internal expectations.”The stock scores an analyst consensus of a Hold based on 11 Holds, 7 Buys and 7 Sells. With shares soaring over 743% in 2020, the average price target of $457.83 implies downside potential of about 35.1% to current levels.Related News:Tesla Inks 5-Year Deal To Buy Lithium From China’s Sichuan Yahua – ReportFord Calls Off Joint Venture With Mahindra; Street Says HoldSouthwest Airlines Signs Agreement with Sabre; Street Sees 14% Upside"
